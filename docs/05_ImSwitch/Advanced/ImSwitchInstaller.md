This tool simplifies the installation process, reducing it to a few clicks and eliminating the need for executing multiple complex commands.

## Requirements

## Installation Guide

1. **Download the Installer:** Choose the appropriate installer (ARM64 for Mac, Windows) from the [releases section](https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitchInstaller/releases/).
2. **Run the Installer:** Double-click the downloaded file. Ignore any security warnings as the installer is not yet signed.
   - For macOS, follow [Apple's guide](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) for running unsigned code.
   - On Windows, grant permission to run the application.
3. **Installation Process:** The installer will set up a Python environment using Mamba in `/User/yourname/ImSwitch` and install all dependencies. This process may take between 10 to 30 minutes depending on your internet connection.
4. **Starting ImSwitch:** Once installed, launch ImSwitch by executing `start imswitch`.
