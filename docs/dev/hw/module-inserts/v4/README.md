# v4 Modules

This is a new version of the cube that has some minor yet very important changes to improve usability and assembly. The main changes are:
- grooves along the optical axis to work together with the master insert in order to lock an insert (e.g. lens) perfectly perpendicular to the optical axis and not movable
- no edges to cut your fingers anymore! 
- moved hole position for the through holes to align it with the new puzzle piecs
- capable of loading 5mm ball magnets to snap them to the grid magnetically 
- same knob foodprint to keep compatibility with v3 baseplates

## Design your own Insert in Tinkercad

Below you can find a step-by-step guide to create your own insert in Tinkercad, a free online 3D design tool. For this you need a free Tinkercad account.

Feel free to copy the template design we created for you: [Tinkercad UC2 Insert Template](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/j9oYjW6ftqo-openuc2-insert-template)

### Steps to get your tinkercad design ready for 3D printing:

Go to Tinkercad.com and login or register for a free account.

As a student of teacher you have access to this for free:

You can also use your google account to login:

Once you're logged in, you can start with a new design or copy our template by clicking on the link above.

Here, we have imported the STL file from below which you can now freely modify or derive it from our template.

You can download the file as an STL and print it.

## Design your own insert in Fusion 360 

We provide an example Fusion360 file for a lens insert that you can modify to create your own insert design. Since we exported it from Autodesk Inventor, the ability to alter the design is lost unfortunately. It is very similar to a STP file in that sense. 
You can find the file here: https://a360.co/3ZvHHal

The editable Fusion360 design files for the UC2 v4 cube and baseplate can be found here: <https://a360.co/4rjtYiu>

## Design Files

### Cad Query

We provide a very open-source friendly CadQuery file that you can use to create your own inserts. You can find it here: https://github.com/openUC2/openuc2-cadquery

It allows you to create inserts parametrically and export them as STL or STEP files. You have full control over the design and fully relies on open-source software.
