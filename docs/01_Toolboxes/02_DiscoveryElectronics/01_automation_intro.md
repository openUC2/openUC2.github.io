## Experiment #1: Testing the USB Serial Interface via the Web

In this first experiment, we’ll walk through how to control the motorized Z-stage and LED array using the web-based serial interface.

### Step 1: Flashing the ESP32 Firmware
1. Before proceeding, ensure your ESP32 board has the latest firmware. You can download and flash the firmware via the official [openUC2 website](https://youseetoo.github.io/), selecting the appropriate version (currently v3 Standalone).

![](./IMAGES/EXP_1_Serial/Electronics_Box_5.png)
*Choose the ESP32 v3 board (not BETA or re-work!) and flash it (but only if you need an update)*

The source-code can be found [here](https://github.com/youseetoo/uc2-esp32)

2. Connect the ESP32 to your computer using the micro-USB cable.

![](./IMAGES/EXP_1_Serial/Electronics_Box_4.png)

3. In your Chrome browser and click on "Connect." A dialog will prompt you to select the COM port for your ESP32, which should show as `CP 20x`. Once connected, you can install the latest firmware by simply clicking the "Install" button. If nothing shows up, you can install the drivers from the following propmpt that results when you hit anywhere on the screen:

![](./IMAGES/EXP_1_Serial/Electronics_Box_3.png)

4. Wait until the firmware has been flashed successfully.

### Step 2: Connecting and Testing the Web Interface
1. After flashing the firmware, go to the testing section on the same website. You’ll find buttons to control the motor and LEDs (This can be tested with the hardware connected or with only the ESP32 connected via USB)

![](./IMAGES/EXP_1_Serial/Electronics_Box_2.png)

2. Connect to your ESP32 board using the "Connect" button again, ensuring the correct COM port is selected.

![](./IMAGES/EXP_1_Serial/Electronics_Box_1.png)

3. Once connected, test the system by sending a simple command:

```json
{"task":"/motor_act", "motor": { "steppers": [ { "stepperid": 3, "position": -1000, "speed": 1000, "isabs": 0, "isaccel": 0} ] } }
```

This command will move the Z-axis motor by -1000 steps (1 full rotation) at a speed of 1000 steps per second. Each step corresponds to a movement of 300nm when using microstepping. You’ll see the motor rotate, adjusting the focus.

> **Note:** Ensure the command string has no line breaks.

### Step 3: Hardware Setup for Testing and controlling the Z-focus Motor
1. Plug the ESP32 board into your computer via USB.
2. Connect the 12V power supply to the provided port.
3. Attach the NEMA 11 motor to the Z-motor port on the board.
4. Turn on the system and verify that the motor responds to commands.
5. The motor should move when you enter the command or hit the buttons.

This first exercise gives you a solid introduction to controlling basic components of the openUC2 system. In future tutorials, we will explore more advanced techniques, such as automated focus stacking and digital phase-contrast imaging -> for this you can have a look here  https://openuc2.github.io/docs/Toolboxes/DiscoveryPhaseMicroscopy/DPCmicroscopy

Feel free to experiment further with different motor and LED settings to familiarize yourself with the control interface. If you have question reach out to us in our forum: openuc2.discourse.group.

### Experiment #2: Building a Microscope and Controlling it with the PS4 Controller

In this experiment, you will build a digital microscope using the components from the openUC2 Discovery Kit and learn how to control the microscope’s motorized stage and LED array using a PS4 controller. This setup allows for intuitive control, perfect for navigating a sample on the XY stage or adjusting focus.


### Step 1: Pairing the PS4 Controller

The UC2-ESP firmware is designed to support various input devices, including the PS4 controller, making it easier to interact with the microscope. You’ve already worked with USB Serial commands, but using the PS4 controller will give you a more flexible, hands-on approach.

#### How to Pair the PS4 Controller:

For more detailed instructions on pairing, refer to the [UC2 PS4 Controller Pairing Guide](https://openuc2.github.io/docs/Electronics/PS4-Controller). But briefly:

1. First, put your PS4 controller into pairing mode by holding down the **Share** button and the **PS button** simultaneously until the light bar starts blinking.
2. Open the serial prompt in your browser (connected to the ESP32 board) or use the web interface.
3. Enter the command:

```json
{"bt_scan":1}
```
This will initiate the Bluetooth scan on the ESP32, which will detect and pair with the controller. Alternatively, you can use the **"Pair Controller"** button in the web interface.

4. Once paired, you should be able to control the motorized stage using the analog sticks on the controller and switch the LED array on/off using the buttons.

### Step 2: Building the Microscope

Next, you will build a motorized digital microscope using the components provided in the kit. This setup will be similar to the **smartphone microscope**, which can be found in detail [here](https://openuc2.github.io/docs/Toolboxes/DiscoveryCore/ENGLISH/coreMicroscope#tutorial-smartphone-microscope), but with the added feature of a motorized Z-stage for fine-tuning the focus and the monocrhome USB-3 caemra

#### Components Needed (in addition to the Smartphone micrsocope):
- **Objective Lens** (RMS 10x or 4x)
- **Motorized Z-Stage** (NEMA 11 stepper motor)
- **LED Array** (for illumination)
- **ESP32 Electronics Board** (with 12V power supply)
- **PS4 Controller**

#### Step-by-Step Assembly:
1. **Mount the Objective Lens**: Attach the RMS-compatible objective to the lens holder on the Z-stage.
2. **Assemble the Z-Stage**: Attach the motorized Z-stage to the base plate and secure the camera above it using the provided baseplates and cubes.
3. **Connect the Electronics**: Plug in the ESP32 board, motorized stage, and LED array. Ensure the 12V power supply is connected to provide power to the motors and LEDs.
4. **Connect the Camera**: Attach the camera to the UC2 setup and connect it to your computer for capturing images.

For detailed assembly steps, refer to the **smartphone microscope** tutorial, which provides an in-depth guide to building the optical system.


### Step 3: Controlling the Microscope with the PS4 Controller

Now that the microscope is built and the PS4 controller is paired, you can control the motorized Z-stage and LED array:

- **Move the Z-stage**: Use the **left analog stick** to move the stage up and down (adjust focus).
- **Control the LEDs**: Use the **controller buttons** to turn the LED array on/off and cycle through different illumination patterns.

This setup allows you to navigate through your sample and adjust focus without touching the hardware, which is particularly useful when working with sensitive samples or in teaching environments where ease of use is essential.

### Video Tutorial

## Experiment (OLD)

### Microscope Assembly:
The assembly process involves combining the different cubes and components to build the finite-corrected microscope. A webcam, Z-stage, 45° folding mirror, sample mount, and LED array are assembled in an L-shape configuration. These cubes are stacked on top of each other to form a complete microscope setup. Optionally, the LED array can be placed in the same cube as the sample or on a separate layer above the sample, creating a 4-layer "tower" setup.

![Microscope Assembly Steps](IMAGES/Incubatormicroscpoe.png)
*Steps involved in assembling the finite-corrected digital microscope.*

Once assembled, the microscope's folded beampath achieves a tubelength of approximately 100mm, which is less than the required 160mm according to the RMS standard for finite-corrected objective lenses. As a result, the magnification is slightly reduced. However, this setup provides a practical example of how to build compact and automated microscopes.

![Microscope Assembly - Side View](IMAGES/Incubatormicroscpoe3.png)
*Side view of the assembled microscope.*

### Instructional Videos:
Two videos guide users through the assembly process:

![](IMAGES/incubatorrot1.gif)

1. Assembling a standard microscope.
2. Assembling a finite-corrected microscope with a webcam.

### Microscope Control:
The motor and the LED array are connected to the openUC2 electronics module. Users can control the hardware components using Web-Serial (Chrome only for now) or the Python interface.

![openUC2 Electronics Module](IMAGES/Electronics.png)
*openUC2 electronics module for controlling the microscope components.*

### Web-Serial Interface:
For control via the web, a new Web-Serial interface is implemented (experimental) and can be accessed at: https:/youseetoo.github.io/indexWebSerialTest.html.

### Getting a Sharp Image:
To achieve a sharp image, it is recommended to test the microscope with a nearly transparent sample and the LED illumination turned on. Users can adjust the focus by hand to find the optimal position (~10-15mm from the last lens). Once found, the sample adapter can be placed at that position, roughly aligning the sample with the focus. Fine adjustments to the focus can then be made using the focus adjustment buttons provided.
