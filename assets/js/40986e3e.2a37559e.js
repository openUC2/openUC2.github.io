This is a relatively simple experiment where we can show both the temporal and especially coherence. We will create a lensless microscope where we use an LED that is filtered by a color filter and pinhole to create a quasi one of chromatic coherent light source. This is then illuminating the transparent sample that is sparse before the scattered wave is sitting the camera sensor. This is relatively simple to build with the C2 system; for this, we only need the LED holder, a gel color filter, as it sees from theaters, aluminum foil where we'll stitch in a hole in order to create a local pinhole, some space between this created light source and the sample, and then the sample that this ultimately glued onto the sensor very closely so that the pinhole virtually scales in size as the ratio between the distance of the light source to the sample and sample to the sensor. In order to build the system, we will place the here created light source on the far left; then another empty cube follows right next to it; then another empty cube follows on the right-hand side; and then we combine the sample mount and the camera into one cube so that the distance between the sample and the camera is minimized. All these cubes should be mounted on puzzle pieces on the lower end and the upper bar so that the whole system becomes stable. We will turn on the camera and also turn on the lights source. Then we go to the web app after connecting to the camera through Wi-Fi, and then we will try to see any variation in the contrast of the camera. If the contrast is not high enough because of this scattering background light, we have to cover the system with a box or with some closing so that there's no straight lights hitting the sensor. This will make a very bad result in the reconstruction. When you're lucky, you can see the sample as a kind of shadow on the sensor already. The core idea now is to reconstruct this digital hologram, where we have to carefully maximize the quality of the file image. Compression artifacts from the ESP32 camera are unavoidable and will eventually degrade the final image results. What we are going to do now is to temper in image and then back propagate the distance from the sensor to the sandal plane using a numerical transformation. What this really means is that we take the image and take every pixel and back propagated by a certain distance numerically. This is done using a fast-year transform where we first fiatransform the image so that it is in frequency space; then we multiply it with a parabolic face Factor, and then we inverse full-year transform the results to end up in real space again. This becomes a convolution of the Fresnel colonel, which essentially propagates every pixel edge of certain distance depending on the wavelength and sampling rate. We can conveniently do that in Python with the Script that is provided by the Jupiter notebook. For this, we go to the website of the ESP32, hit the capture button, and download the image onto the computer. Then we start the Jupiter notebook server by opening the command line in Windows or in Linux and enter Jupiter notebook. Then we go to the browser and open the example Jupiter notebook that will reconstruct our hologram. We will enter the path of our downloaded image file and then reconstruct the results. There are several problems which we can describe but not solve at the moment for stop inland holography, as the name already says, has the problem that the light source and the scattered wave interfere in line. That means the point source will create spherical waves that are propagating its free space and will become almost a plain wave when it's the sample. Here some parts of the wave are scattered where which means that a plane wave is altered in its face depending on the face of the microscopic example, and some portion of the wave is an altered. That means after the sample the unchecked and scattered wave are propagating to the sensor where the two amplitudes are superposing. That means they add up for stuff since our camera detector cannot record amplitudes since the object of frequency is very very high. We are averaging out over time. That means that we will record intensity values in the end. This also means that the information about the face is getting lost. When we are reconstructing the hologram, the color will differentiate whether the sample is before or behind the sensor since the face information is that anymore. This means that in the reconstruction, the so-called twin image always overlays the real image in the end. This causes an avoidable ringing artifacts in the reconstruction. There are some ways to remove it, for example by estimating the face using iterative algorithms or model-based approaches, where we take the full image acquisition process into account. Alternatively, suit also be machine learning algorithms where an algorithm estimates the background and remove these artifacts. However, here we won't use these algorithms as we just want to learn how we can reconstruct the simple."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Some notes on the transform that we have just used here. Briefly, it is a transformation from spatial to frequency coordinates. This sounds very abstract, but for example, our ear does this all the time. When we talk, our voice generates a vibration of the air. That means different frequencies are oscillating and add up to something like noise. Our ear, in turn, has the cochlear where many nerve cells, in turn, are oscillating depending on the resonance frequency of every cell. In a way, they are unmixing the noise and modulate the different frequencies. That means that if you're singing like an A, there is the fundamental frequency and several higher and lower harmonics. And lens does something very similar but in two dimensions. You can have optical frequencies where, for example, a grating that is having stripes that represent on and off and on and off"),(0,i.kt)("p",null," at a certain distance represent periodic structure. It lens when you place something in the focal plane will then flea transform this into the demodulated frequency components. When you, for example, have a periodic structure like a grating, it will produce two pieces in its Fourier transform or in its focal length on the object side. A fast Fourier transform is its equivalent in the computational science. You can take an image and then represent it in its frequency components for stock that means it tries to estimate the sum of all the different frequency components that make up the image. We use this fast Fourier transform in our code to bring it from real space to frequency space and back again. But since we start with an image without an amplitude or without the face, lack the information."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"This property creates additional artifacts since relax the information of the face when we record intensity values on our camera, we also limited to samples that I see like just for the tomt capture in the watcher. The optical resolution of our microscope is bound to the pixel size and the opening angle or the numerical aperture that is created by the illumination and the sensor size that we use to detect the image. However, it is a very nice way of demonstrating how long profil works and how we can detect images without a lens. For stop many different have used it, for example, to detect Malaria in blood.
