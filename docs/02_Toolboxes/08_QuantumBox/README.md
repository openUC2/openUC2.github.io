## What You'll Learn

- Principles of optical interferometry
- Coherence and interference of light waves
- Quantum mechanical concepts in optics
- Polarization phenomena
- Precision optical alignment techniques
- ODMR (Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance)

## Experiments in this Section

### 1. Michelson Interferometer
Build the classic interferometer that has been fundamental in advancing our understanding of light and space-time. The Michelson interferometer splits a coherent beam into two paths and recombines them to create interference patterns that reveal optical path differences and wave properties.

**Learn:** Wave optics, coherence, optical path differences, precision alignment

### 2. Mach-Zehnder Interferometer
Construct a split-beam interferometer where reference and sample beams travel through completely separate paths before recombination. This configuration is particularly powerful for quantitative phase imaging and microscopy applications.

**Learn:** Split-beam interferometry, phase imaging, holography, off-axis techniques

### 3. Polarization Experiments
Explore how light's polarization can be manipulated and analyzed through various experiments including:
- Crossed polarizers
- Stress birefringence in materials
- Three polarizer paradox
- Malus's Law

**Learn:** Polarization states, birefringence, optical activity, polarimetry

### 4. Quantum Eraser Experiment
*(Coming soon)* A fascinating demonstration of quantum mechanical principles where which-path information can be "erased" to restore interference patterns.

**Learn:** Quantum mechanics, complementarity principle, wave-particle duality

### 5. ODMR (Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance)
Explore the interaction between light, magnetic fields, and electron spins using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. This experiment demonstrates quantum sensing and is available in both English and German tutorials.

**Learn:** Quantum sensing, electron spin resonance, NV centers, magnetic field detection
