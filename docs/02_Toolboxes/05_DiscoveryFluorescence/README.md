# Discovery Fluorescence Box

The Discovery Fluorescence Box enables you to explore the fascinating world of fluorescence microscopy. Using laser excitation, you can visualize fluorescent molecules and structures that are invisible under conventional illumination.

## What is Fluorescence?

Fluorescence is a photophysical process where electrons are excited to a higher energy state by absorbing light at one wavelength (excitation) and then emit light at a longer wavelength (emission) as they return to the ground state. The difference in wavelengths, known as the Stokes shift, allows selective detection of fluorescent signals.
