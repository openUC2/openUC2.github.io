## Basic Operation (FRAME System)

The FRAME system is fully motorized and operated through software interfaces. All system control is achieved through:
- **ImSwitch Web Interface**: Primary graphical user interface accessible via web browser
- **PS4 Controller**: Alternative hardware interface for manual positioning and control

### Basic Microscopy Setup

#### Sample Preparation and Loading

1. **Sample Mounting**:
   - Clean sample holder thoroughly
   - Mount sample according to type:
     - **Standard slides**: Use slide clips
     - **Petri dishes**: Use dish holder
     - **Custom samples**: Use appropriate fixtures
   - Ensure sample is secure and level

![](./IMAGES/04/FRAME_INSERTSAMPLE_1.jpg)

![](./IMAGES/04/FRAME_INSERTSAMPLE_2.jpg)

![](./IMAGES/04/FRAME_INSERTSAMPLE_3.jpg)


2. **Sample Positioning**:
   - Use coarse XY adjustment to center sample
   - Adjust Z-position for initial focus
   - Use fine adjustments for precise positioning

Sample positioning can be performed using either the PlayStation controller or the web GUI. The GUI provides a sample map where you can click anywhere to move the microscope to that position. Periodically, you may need to recalibrate the absolute positioning system to ensure accuracy. Use the stage center calibration tool in the web GUI to perform this calibration process.

#### Illumination Setup

The FRAME system offers multiple illumination modes:

**Transmission Illumination**: A high-powered white LED mounted above the sample provides transmission lighting with a lens system for K√∂hler illumination. Concentric LED rings around the main LED enable various contrast mechanisms including phase contrast, darkfield, and oblique illumination. Each RGB LED can be individually controlled to enable advanced techniques like Fourier ptychography microscopy.

**Fluorescence Illumination**: Multiple fluorescence excitation options are available from below, including laser excitation combined with dichroic filters to illuminate the sample from below.

All illumination settings are accessible through the main GUI illumination controls.

1. **Transmitted Light (Brightfield)**:
   - Turn on LED illumination
   - Adjust intensity using the LED slider in the GUI
   - Currently there are no mechanisms to center the LED - alignment assumes it is concentric with the objective lens after proper setup
   - The illumination NA is predefined by the LED lens system
   - Different numerical apertures can be achieved by turning on/off different rings of the LED matrix
 

2. **LED Matrix Illumination Setup**:
   ```
   üìù NOTE: K√∂hler illumination provides optimal image quality.
   ```

**LED Matrix Operation**: The LEDs arranged concentrically around the high-power LED enable various contrast mechanisms including darkfield, quantitative phase contrast, and Fourier ptychography. These can also be used for annular intensity diffraction tomography.

   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION: Running all LEDs in bright mode consumes ~20W and generates significant heat.
   The LED array will automatically shut off if temperature exceeds 100¬∞C.
   Do not operate all LEDs simultaneously for extended periods.
   ```

Different illumination patterns can be selected from the LED Matrix menu in the UI:

**Darkfield Mode**: Set different LED ring diameters to match numerical apertures just above the detecting objective. This eliminates direct light (zero order) through the objective lens, measuring only scattered light. This creates a dark background with bright sample features. Larger ring diameters correspond to higher numerical aperture values.

**Quantitative/Differential Phase Contrast**: Sequential activation of left/right and top/bottom LED patterns provides different information for computing sample phase relative to amplitude. This technique is useful for imaging transparent samples like unlabeled biological cells. After capturing four images, compute the differential phase contrast image by subtracting opposite sides and dividing by their sum. The system can automate this process and acquire images in sequence.

**Phase Contrast Ring**: Similar to darkfield, turn on the ring at a diameter matching the phase ring inside the objective. When the rings overlap properly, the zero order diffraction is dimmed, promoting phase variations in the sample. Proper alignment can be verified by observing the C-mount ring on the camera - you should see two concentric rings (one from the light, one from the objective). When these rings match in size and concentricity, a phase contrast image should appear.



 

### Focus Control

#### Coarse Focus
- **Range**: +/-4 mm vertical travel
- **Use**: Initial focusing and large adjustments
- **Technique**: Use smooth, controlled movements with the joystick or plus/minus buttons in the GUI
- **Safety**: Avoid contact between objective and sample - lens damage may occur!

Use the PlayStation controller's left joystick for up/down movement or the UI buttons for relative and absolute positioning.

#### Fine Focus
- **Use**: Precise focusing for high-magnification work using the rear paddles on the controller or reduced step size in the GUI
- **Technique**: Small incremental adjustments

Use the rear paddles on the PlayStation controller for precise objective lens movement or the GUI elements in the web interface for fine focus control.

### Stage Operation

#### Sample Navigation
1. **Initial Positioning**: Use coarse movements to locate area of interest
2. **Fine Positioning**: Use small adjustments for precise positioning
3. **Systematic Scanning**: Use consistent patterns for sample survey

Stage navigation can be performed using either the PlayStation controller or the web UI interface.

## Inner Cube System Operation

### Understanding the Inner Cube System

The FRAME microscope employs a unique modular cube drawer system that forms the heart of its optical configuration. The inner cube system consists of multiple cube holders that slide into the main optical frame, allowing for flexible optical path configuration.

**Calibration of Pixel Size by Capturing a Ruler**

The microscope does not know its physical properties, so we must calibrate the motion axes to convert from steps to millimeters and from pixels to millimeters. These values are stored in the configuration file but require initial calibration. For linear stages, this depends on hardware specifications and is already pre-configured.

When objective magnification changes, the effective pixel size changes and requires recalibration. To calibrate:
1. Take a ruler with known dimensions
2. Capture an image
3. Open the file in Fiji to measure the number of pixels for a given unit on the calibration slide
4. Calculate pixel size: divide the known distance (e.g., 1 millimeter) by the number of pixels (e.g., 1000 pixels) to get pixel size (1 micrometer in this example)

The procedure is explained in the video:
![](./IMAGES/04/calibratingpixelsize.mp4)

ToDo Armin 250804: Video does not show up in the doc

**Capturing a Large Panorama Using Multiple Tiles and Opening in Fiji**

The experiment controller has a built-in sample overview map where you can select an area using the max dome selector. This area is then scanned sequentially in XY to produce a stitched imaging result. The procedure is explained in the video:
