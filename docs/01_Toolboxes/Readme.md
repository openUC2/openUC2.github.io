# BOXES

Here you can find the Documentation for all the different Boxes for example:

## CoreBox: Entry-Level Education Box
     - Features and Specifications
     - Assembling the CoreBox
     - Core Lens, Telescope, and Microscope

## ElectronicsBox: Extension of CoreBox
     - Adding Modules to the Discovery Kit
     - Enhanced Functionality

## InfinityBox: Extension of ElectronicsBox
    - Enabling camera-based microscopy
    - With infinity-corrected optics

## FluoBox: Extension of InfinityBox
    - LED or Laser based
    - Enabling camera-based fluorescence microscopy

## LightSheetBox: Extrension of FluoBox (Laser)
    - new modules to build a light sheet Microscope
    - moving through probes with included the xyz-stage

## QBox
     - inlcudes Interferometer and polarisation experiments
     - You can build a Michelson Interferometer
     - Try enhancing it to become a MAch Zhender Microscope
     - Ultimatively test the microscope extension and reconstruct images using holography
     - to learn about Polarisation the set inlcudes the Brewster angle experiment
     - as well as the Newton Ring experiment

##Seeed microscope
     - Created in collaboration with Seeed Studio
     - ideal for hackers, optics newcomers, and biologists
     - more functionalities than a standard USB microscope including:
     - timelapse
     -  autofocusing
     - autonomous operation with image storage on an SD card.
