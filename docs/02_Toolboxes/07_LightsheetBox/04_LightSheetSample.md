## Protocol to align the light-sheet w.r.t. the focus plane

## Alignment Protocol for Light-Sheet Microscope Focus Plane

Efficient alignment of the light-sheet with the microscope objective lens's focus plane is crucial for optimal imaging results. This protocol outlines the steps to achieve precise alignment using fluorescent markers and manipulation of the kinematic mirror.

![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/LightsheetTutorial_9.jpg)

**Alignment Steps:**

1. **Fluorescent Marker Setup:**
   - Begin by ensuring that the light-sheet is coplanar with the microscope's objective lens field of view.
   - Use a fluorescent pen marker to label the embedding media, effectively visualizing the light-sheet.

 ![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/LightsheetTutorial_8.jpg)

2. **Activating the Laser:**
   - Turn on the laser source either via ImSwitch software or the web interface [https://youseetoo.github.io/indexWebSerialTest.html](https://youseetoo.github.io/indexWebSerialTest.html).


3. **Visualizing the Light-Sheet:**
   - With the laser activated, you should observe the light-sheet within the water chamber. Refer to the provided image for a reference.

4. **Kinematic Mirror Adjustment:**
   - The three screws on the kinematic mirror in the right corner control the orientation of the light-sheet in 3D space.
   - Familiarize yourself with the degrees of freedom associated with these screws.

![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/LightsheetTutorial_6.jpg)


5. **Fundamental Considerations:**
   - The cylindrical lens focuses the primary light-sheet in the backfocal plane of the illumination objective (4x, 0.1 NA).
   - Rotating the objective lens adjusts the orientation of the light-sheet.
   - The square orientation of the cylindrical lens ensures proper alignment with the detection objective lens.
   - The primary light-sheet exits the cylindrical lens at the center.
   - The kinematic mirror manipulates the light-sheet's position in the x and y directions, as well as introducing an offset.
   - Correct mirror alignment is crucial, placing it precisely at the diagonal center of the cube.
   - This central placement ensures that the primary light-sheet enters the objective lens's backfocal plane (BFP) at the center.
   - Such alignment results in the secondary illuminating light-sheet being parallel to the detection lens's focus plane.
   - Observe the effects of rotating the screws and adjust accordingly.

![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/LightsheetTutorial_7.jpg)

6. **Fluorescent Solution Application:**
   - Utilize a syringe for convenient application of the fluorescent solution.

![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/LightsheetTutorial_10.jpg)
7. **Sample Cube Handling:**
   - The sample cube is magnetically held, facilitating easy removal for cleaning.
   - Take care as the sample cube's coverslips are relatively thin and can break.

   ![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/IMG_20230811_163453.jpg)

Achieving precise alignment between the light-sheet and the objective lens's focus plane is critical for obtaining accurate imaging results. This protocol provides a systematic approach to optimizing your light-sheet microscope setup. For further assistance or questions, feel free to reach out to our community and support channels. Your engagement contributes to the ongoing refinement of the openUC2 light-sheet microscope system.

## Finding the the focus (waiste) of the light-sheet

To effectively align the light-sheet in your setup, it's crucial to follow these two key steps:

**Step 1: Centering the Sheet within the Field of View (FOV)**
1. Begin by ensuring that the waist of the light-sheet is positioned at the center of the microscope's field of view (FOV).
2. To achieve this, the cylindrical lens needs to be temporarily removed. Carefully release the lower puzzle pieces to detach the cylindrical lens cube.

![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/LightsheetTutorial_2.jpg)

3. With the cylindrical lens removed, a collimated beam should enter the back focal plane (BFP) of the illuminating objective lens.
4. Adjust the kinematic mirror to guide the round beam, approximately 10mm in diameter, into the center of the BFP of the illuminating objective lens. This alignment should be parallel to the optical axis.

**Step 2: Achieving Focus with the Detection Objective Lens**
1. Activate the camera, such as using Galaxy Viewer software that comes with the camera drivers, to observe the light-sheet's focus.
2. The fluorescently labeled region should now exhibit a focused beam, perceptible to the naked eye.
3. Initiate axial movement of the objective lens (Axis Z) using the online control website. You'll notice an increase in intensity at either the positive or negative direction until the light-sheet focus becomes visible within the field of view.

![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/LightsheetTutorial_3.jpg)

4. To optimize focus, make fine adjustments to the kinematic mirror to direct the light-sheet beam if it's positioned too high or too low.
5. It's common for the light-sheet's focus not to align precisely with the center of the FOV. In this case, carefully adjust the position of the illuminating objective lens along the cube axis to relocate the focus positions.
6. Once you're content with the alignment, deactivate the laser and reinsert the cylindrical lens.
7. Notably, this step doesn't need to be repeated each time the light-sheet is activated. The position of the cylindrical lens is relatively stable and doesn't require frequent recalibration.

Following these steps meticulously will ensure that the light-sheet is accurately aligned both within the FOV's center and in-focus with the detection objective lens. This alignment process is essential for obtaining reliable and high-quality imaging results with the openUC2 light-sheet microscope.

![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/LightsheetTutorial_4.jpg)

Once the cylindrical lens is back in, you can readjust the light-sheet wr.t. to the focus plane of the objective lens since they may be a slight variation after reassembly.


## Brightfield imaging

In case you want to image the sample in transmisson mode, turn on the Neopixel LED that is connected to the sample cube and optionally remove the fluorescent filter by pulling it up and store it somewhere safe (dust and scratch free!).


## Using the Fully Assembled Light-Sheet Microscope for Sample Imaging

Now that all components are meticulously aligned, the openUC2 light-sheet microscope is primed for sample imaging. Follow these steps to prepare and capture your fluorescent sample:

![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/LightsheetSample_6.jpg)

1. **Sample Preparation:**
   - Begin by preparing your fluorescent sample according to the specified protocols.
   - Carefully follow the steps outlined in the dedicated sample preparation section within this document.

2. **Assembling the Sample Holder:**
   - Loosen the nut that secures the syringe and insert the syringe into the sample holder.
   - Gradually lower the syringe so that the tip of the sample barely touches the light-sheet within the sample plane.

![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/LightsheetSample_7.jpg)

3. **Squeezing out the Agarose:**
   - Squeeze out the agarose gently from the syringe while observing the sample, starting with brightfield imaging.
   - Monitor the camera's image stream to ensure the sample becomes visible within the field of view.

![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/LightsheetSample_8.jpg)

4. **Observing Brightfield Image:**
   - If the sample isn't immediately visible, confirm its positioning within the sample cube and make minor adjustments in XYZ to bring it into view on the camera screen.
   - Once visible in brightfield, deactivate the LED light source.

![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/LightsheetSample_9.jpg)

5. **Switching to Laser Illumination:**
   - Turn on the laser source, and initially, remove the fluorescent filter.
   - Adjust the imaging settings to enhance contrast and visibility, increasing intensity, exposure time, and/or camera gain until you obtain a clear, well-exposed image with minimal noise.

6. **Fine-tuning Laser Position:**
   - Using bright scattering as a guide, locate the laser's position while ensuring you have reinserted the fluorescent filter.
   - Adjust the intensity as needed.

7. **Sample Positioning:**
   - Manipulate the sample's position in XYZ space to center it on a region of interest.

8. **ImSwitch Scan and Reconstruction:**
   - Utilize ImSwitch software's scan and reconstruction plugin to perform scans of your sample.
   - The specific scan and reconstruction process details are provided in the ImSwitch documentation.

This completes the procedure for imaging your fluorescent sample using the fully assembled openUC2 light-sheet microscope. With careful preparation and precise adjustments, you can capture high-quality volumetric images that offer valuable insights into the structure and behavior of your sample. Your engagement with the microscope's capabilities contributes to ongoing advancements in microscopic research and exploration.

## Mount the sample on a metal tip

Glue the sample on an M5 set screw using super glue or blutek (non-safe, sample can fall off). Insects offer a great level of fluorescent signal due to autofluorescence and act as nice training samples that can simply hang down using this method

![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/Samplemount.png)


**Sample Preparation Protocol for openUC2 Light-Sheet Microscope Imaging: Fluorescently Labeled Zebrafish**

This simplified protocol outlines the steps to prepare a fluorescently labeled zebrafish sample for imaging using the openUC2 light-sheet microscope. This method involves embedding the sample in an agarose cylinder for stable imaging in an aqueous environment. the "aquarium" or water-filled sample chamber is used to do refractive index matching as the sample would scatter too much light otherwise.

**Materials Required:**
- 1.5% Agar
- Glass capillary
- Zebrafish embryo (some other volumetric, mostly clear sample that can be excited at 488nm)
- Sample medium
- Falcon tube or small beaker
- syringe or FEP tube (optional, for increased stability)

**Procedure:**

**Mounting in Free-Hanging Agarose Cylinder:**

0. Take the syringe and cut away the tip
1. Melt 1.5% agar at 70ÂºC and maintain it at 37ÂºC.
2. Insert the plunger into the syringe capillary, ensuring the white end barely protrudes and suck in enough agarose
3. Gently place the zebrafish embryo into the already solidified agarose, minimizing the water content.
4. Pull the plunger to draw up about 3cm (1 inch) of melted agarose.
5. Carefully position the sample close to the capillary's end.
6. Allow the agarose to set for 1-2 minutes.
7. When ready to image, gently push the plunger down to extrude the agarose cylinder with the sample, placing it just outside the capillary for imaging.


## Further tweaks for the system

These steps are not necessary, but help you to customize the microscope to better match your sample configuration.

### Remove the xyz stage from the top

In case you want to do maintenance on the microscope, the xyz stage can easily be removed by releasing the M3x55mm screws from the bottom part. Therfore, remove the puzzle piece that has be mounted below the objective lens and release the 3 screws that mount the stage plate to the uppoer part of the microscope. You can now release the stage. In order to move it back on, do the reverse process.

![](./IMAGES/LightsheetSample/IMG_20230811_165551.jpg)


### Swap the sample mounting plate

In principle the XYZ stage can mount any sample geometry. We wanted to start with something and adapted the common syringe mount. Only two screws from below have to be released in order to swap the sample mount plate:
