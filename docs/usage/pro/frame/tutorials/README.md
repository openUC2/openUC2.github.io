# Hands-On Tutorials

Welcome to our instructional tutorials for the FRAME! Here, we'll learn about how to use the FRAME— by using the FRAME!

Our practical tutorials are organized by a progression of the things you need to learn to do in order to use your FRAME machine effectively:

1. In the [day-1 (deployment) tutorials](./day-1/README.md), we will set up a FRAME and use it to acquire data for the first time.
2. In the [day-2 (routine tasks) tutorials](./day-2/README.md), we will TODO.

If you're here because you want to learn about what the FRAME is and whether the FRAME might be useful for you, our [in-depth explanatory documentation](../explanations/README.md) may be more useful for you.
