# ODMR - Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance

Learn how to implement Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) experiments using UC2 hardware. ODMR is a quantum sensing technique that detects magnetic resonance through changes in optical fluorescence, commonly used with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond.

## What is ODMR?

ODMR combines optical spectroscopy with magnetic resonance to detect spin transitions in color centers (like NV centers in diamond). When these quantum defects are exposed to specific microwave frequencies in the presence of a magnetic field, their fluorescence intensity changes, allowing detection of magnetic resonance without traditional RF coils.
