# Experiment 2: Autofocus and Miniaturized Stage for Large Samples with the UC2 Electronic

## Introduction

Why would one need a modular microscope like the openUC2 XIAO when a $10 USB microscope from AliExpress might suffice? The answer lies in the versatility and expandability of the openUC2 XIAO. This hackable microscope allows for the adaptation of various modules, enhancing its functionality significantly. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to add autofocus and stage scanning capabilities using simple components and a few 3D-printed parts.

## Connectivity of openUC2 with the Microscope

The general idea of connecting various microscope components like an X-stage or a focus motor to the Xiao Microscope is illustrated in the diagram below. The microscope provides a server and an access point for Wi-Fi. An app connects to the microscope to start the image stream and control camera commands. Another ESP32 with our firmware connects to the microscope via Wi-Fi, performing a handshake so the microscope recognizes devices like LEDs or focus motors. Control commands are sent from the app through the microscope to the motor, all using HTTP REST commands.

## Adding Motorized Focusing

The Xiao Microscope has a high-precision micrometer screw for moving the objective lens along the optical axis to achieve focus. For high magnification, a motor can help move the focus knob precisely without manual intervention. A simple and inexpensive servo motor can move the focus knob by Â±90Â°, connected via a slip clutch to avoid damage.

## Adding Stage Scanning

Stage scanning allows the automatic movement of the sample to enlarge the visible field. We use a simple servo motor to move a rubber-band-fitted sled, carrying the sample along an axis. This method provides a reliable movement path using steel rods salvaged from old CD/DVD drives.

### Experiment 3: Timelapse of Yeast Cells

Hereâ€™s an enhanced version of the documentation for your GitHub tutorial:

---

### Experiment 3: Timelapse of HeLa Cells (or Any Other Moving Subject)

In this experiment, you will capture a timelapse of growing yeast cells (or any other subject that changes over time) to observe and study their behavior and development. The setup process can be easily managed via the Web GUI.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Prepare the SD Card**:
   - Insert a FAT32-formatted SD card into your Xiao device.
   - Verify that the SD card mounts correctly by monitoring the USB Serial output. The output should indicate successful mounting, e.g., as "SDHC".
   - If you need to format your SD card to FAT32, use the official SD Card Formatter tool. You can download it [here](#).

![](./IMAGES/OpenUC2xSeeed/SDCard_1.png)

![](./IMAGES/OpenUC2xSeeed/SDCard_2.png)


2. **Insert the SD Card**:
   - Insert the SD card into the SD card slot on the Xiao device. The slot is larger than the card, so using tweezers can help with precise insertion.
   - Check the Serial Output on startup to confirm that the SD card has been mounted correctly. If mounted, the card type (e.g., SDHC) will be displayed.

![](./IMAGES/OpenUC2xSeeed/IMG_20240820_073109.jpg)


3. **Configure the Timelapse Settings**:
   - **Set the Timelapse Interval**: Access the Web GUI at `http://192.168.4.1`. Use the slider to set a suitable interval for capturing images (e.g., 60 seconds for one image per minute).
   - **Enable Timelapse Mode**: Activate the timelapse feature by toggling the timelapse switch in the Web GUI.
   - **Verify SD Card Mounting**: Ensure the SD card is still mounted by checking the SD card name; it should show a value greater than 0.

4. **Start Capturing the Timelapse**:
   - Once the timelapse is enabled, the device will start capturing images at the set interval.
   - Note that the live stream may temporarily go off after each image is captured. This is normal behavior.
   - You can refresh the Web GUI page to see the image counter increase, indicating that new images are being saved to the SD card.

![](./IMAGES/OpenUC2xSeeed/IMG_20240816_101110.jpg)


5. **Retrieve the Images**:
   - After the timelapse is complete, carefully remove the SD card from the Xiao device.
   - Transfer the images from the SD card to your computer.
   - The images will be named with an incremental number corresponding to each timelapse capture and include a CPU timestamp measured in microseconds for precise timing information.

#### Tips and Troubleshooting

- **SD Card Compatibility**: Not all SD cards may work with the Xiao device. If your card is not recognized, try a different one.
- **Timelapse Duration**: Consider the length of your experiment when setting the timelapse interval to avoid excessive data or missed events.
- **Web GUI Connection**: Ensure your device is connected to the correct network to access the Web GUI. If you encounter issues, try restarting the Xiao or rechecking the network configuration.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully capture and analyze a timelapse of cellular or other biological processes with ease.

#### Code to convert images from the SD card into a video

Once the experiment is done, you would need to convert the images into a video. This can be done by carefully removing the micro SD card from the microscope and inserting it into your computer. We used a microSD card adapter and inserted that into the SD card slot of our macbook. Then we download all images into a local folder and execute the below script. The SD card will have multiple files in one single folder (base-folder) which may cause problems if you had mutiple timeseries acquired one after another. Therfore, the camera writes an `index.txt` file where the file names are stored in consecutive order. The below script will read the files based on this index file and outputs the videofile (or TIF file respectively). Adjust the filepaths accordingly.

```py
import numpy as np
import tifffile as tif
import os
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# load the images from the list
basePath = '/Users/bene/Downloads/2024_08_27-Cells_XiaoMicroscope_Lena'
savePathFile = 'ImageStack.tif'
fileIndexList = os.path.join(basePath, 'index.txt')

# read the list of files
mAllFiles = []
with open(fileIndexList, 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        mAllFiles.append(line.strip())

# select images from the list
mSelectedFiles = mAllFiles[2500:-1]
mSelectedFiles

#video writer
width, height, _ = plt.imread(basePath + mSelectedFiles[0] + '.jpg').shape
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'XVID')
out = cv2.VideoWriter(os.path.join(basePath, 'output.avi'), fourcc, 40, (height,width))

# read images and save as tiff/mp4
for iFile in mSelectedFiles:
    # read the image
    try:

        mImage = plt.imread(basePath + iFile + '.jpg')
        frame = cv2.convertScaleAbs(mImage)
        out.write(frame)

        print("read image: ", iFile, " with shape: ", mImage.shape)
        # save the image as tiff
        # tif.imsave(os.path.join(basePath, savePathFile), mImage, append=True, bigtiff=True)
    except:
        continue

out.release()
```

The result (Sorry for the bad compression of the result):

![](./IMAGES/OpenUC2xSeeed/output.gif)

and also as a youtube video in slighlty better quality (next time I'll share the raw video :)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omXEBV_astQ?si=XFezMBOowycvvTLO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Heat Dissipation of the microscope

The microscope did not show any heat buildup when placed in the cell incubator. So the effect of massive abopotosis may be found in an infection event.
