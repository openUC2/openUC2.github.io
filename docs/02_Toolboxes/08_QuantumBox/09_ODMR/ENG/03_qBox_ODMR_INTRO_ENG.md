# Introduction to NV Centers, Electron Spin, and ODMR

You can find additional information from our colleagues over at the University / FH Münster. They have educator's friendly documentation for the different types of **Inteferometers**, **ODMR**, etc.

## 1. What is an NV Center?

An **NV center** (“Nitrogen-Vacancy”) is a **point defect** in the crystal lattice of **diamond**, consisting of:

* a **nitrogen atom** replacing a carbon atom, and
* an adjacent **vacancy**.

In its **negatively charged form (NV⁻)** it contains **6 electrons**, distributed over four molecular orbitals (\$a\_1\$, \$a\_1'\$, \$e\_x\$, \$e\_y\$). Two electrons with **parallel-aligned spin** occupy the degenerate orbitals \$e\_x\$ and \$e\_y\$, resulting in a **total spin S = 1**.

## 2. What is Spin?

**Spin** is a fundamental quantum-mechanical property of particles, analogous to an intrinsic angular momentum. It is:

* **not a real rotation**, but a quantized property with two possible states for the electron:

  $$
  m_s = +\tfrac{1}{2} \quad \text{(spin-up)}, \quad m_s = -\tfrac{1}{2} \quad \text{(spin-down)}
  $$
* responsible for:

  * the **Pauli principle**: no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state.
  * **Hund’s rule**: orbitals are singly filled with **parallel spins** first.

In NV centers the spin value is even \$S = 1\$, allowing three projections: \$m\_s = 0, +1, -1\$.

## 3. Energy Levels in the NV Center

The NV center has:

* a **triplet ground state** \$|g⟩\$,
* a **triplet excited state** \$|e⟩\$,
* a **non-fluorescent singlet intermediate state** \$|s⟩\$.

Through **spin-spin interactions** (even without a magnetic field!), the ground state is split into:

* \$|g, m\_s = 0⟩\$ and
* \$|g, m\_s = ±1⟩\$

The energy splitting is:

$$
D_g \approx 2.87 \text{ GHz}
$$

## 4. Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR)

### Basic Idea

* The NV center is excited with **green light (532 nm)**.
* It fluoresces in the red range (\~637–800 nm) **depending on the spin state**.

### Fluorescence Pathways

* \$|e,0⟩ \rightarrow |g,0⟩\$: **radiative transition** → **bright fluorescence**
* \$|e,±1⟩ \rightarrow |s⟩ \rightarrow |g,0⟩\$: **non-radiative** → **dark**

### Microwave Excitation

* Microwaves at **2.87 GHz** induce **spin flips** between \$|g,0⟩\$ and \$|g,±1⟩\$.
* The electron ends up in a less fluorescent state ⇒ **dip in fluorescence**.

### With External Magnetic Field

* A **static magnetic field** along the NV axis causes a **Zeeman effect**, further splitting \$|g,+1⟩\$ and \$|g,-1⟩\$.
* Two resonance frequencies appear ⇒ two dips in the ODMR spectrum.

## 5. Key Questions and Answers

### ▶ Why do the \$m\_s = ±1\$ states split?

Due to **zero-field splitting** from spin-spin interaction in the crystal field.

### ▶ What is the singlet state?

A **non-radiative intermediate state** through which electrons from \$|e,±1⟩\$ relax to \$|g,0⟩\$ – **without photon emission**.

### ▶ How does the electron go from \$|g,0⟩\$ to \$|g,±1⟩\$?

Via **targeted microwave excitation** at **2.87 GHz**, matching the energy splitting.

## 6. ODMR Signal – What Is Measured?

* The ODMR signal is the **fluorescence intensity as a function of microwave frequency**.
* Without microwaves: maximum fluorescence.
* At resonance: fluorescence decreases (spin is flipped out of \$m\_s = 0\$).
* With magnetic fields: two absorption dips instead of one.

## 7. Why Is This Important?

* **Quantum sensing**: precise measurement of magnetic fields (nanotesla range).
* **Quantum information**: spin states serve as **qubits**.
* **Biophysics & materials science**: sensors for temperature, electric fields, pH, etc.

## 8. Summary Mnemonic

## 9. States:

### 1. Optical Excitation Only (532 nm, no Magnetic Field, no Microwave)

The NV center is excited with a 532 nm laser: electrons go from the ground state \$|g⟩\$ to the excited state \$|e⟩\$.
There are two pathways back:

* \$|e,0⟩ \rightarrow |g,0⟩\$ with strong fluorescence
* \$|e,±1⟩ \rightarrow\$ non-radiative transition via singlet state \$|s⟩ \rightarrow |g,0⟩\$ ⇒ reduced fluorescence

Result: most NV centers end up in \$|g,0⟩\$. This is called optical pumping into the \$m\_s = 0\$ state.

### 2. Optical Excitation + Microwave (2.87 GHz)

A microwave at 2.87 GHz matches the splitting between \$|g,0⟩\$ and \$|g,±1⟩\$ (zero-field splitting \$D\_g\$).
This induces a spin flip:

* Electrons are periodically swapped between \$|g,0⟩ ⇄ |g,±1⟩\$ (Rabi oscillations).

Consequence: more electrons end up in \$|e,±1⟩\$, which then relax via the singlet state ⇒ fluorescence darkens.

### 3. Optical Excitation + Microwave + External Magnetic Field

An external magnetic field \$B∥\$ along the NV axis splits the degenerate \$m\_s = ±1\$ level (Zeeman effect).
Now there are two distinct resonance frequencies:
\$|g,0⟩→|g,+1⟩\$
\$|g,0⟩→|g,-1⟩\$
Sweeping the microwave frequency → two dips in fluorescence. This is the typical ODMR signal under a magnetic field.
