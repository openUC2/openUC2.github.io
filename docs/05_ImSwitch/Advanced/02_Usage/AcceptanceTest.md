# Acceptance Test of a Microscope (FRAME)

We have prepared a little acceptance test script to verify that a FRAME microscope is working as expected after assembly. This test covers basic functionalities of the microscope, including:
- homing of the axes 
- movement of the axes
- illumination control
- image acquisition
- autofocus
It will create a report with the results of the tests. The microscope does not have sensors to verify the positions of the axes, so the test relies on the assumption that if the axes move or illumination is controlled, you as a user give feedback. 

Here is a little guide on how to run the acceptance test:
