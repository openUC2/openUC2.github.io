# PS4 Controller

The PS4 controller provides intuitive wireless control of your UC2 microscope system, enabling hands-free operation of stages, focus, illumination, and scanning functions.

## Overview

Using Bluetooth connectivity, the PS4 controller connects to the ESP32-based UC2 board to provide comprehensive control over all microscope functions. This allows you to operate your microscope without touching it, reducing vibrations and improving imaging quality.
