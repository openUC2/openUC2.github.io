# How-To Guides

:::tip

If this is your first time deploying a FRAME machine, we strongly recommend going through the [full tutorials](../tutorials/day-1/README.md) instead, so that you can learn how to use the FRAME effectively. The guides here are not meant for learning.

:::

Our how-to guides are written for people who already have previous familiarity with deploying and operating FRAME machines.
Here, we assume that you just need concise information about how to perform particular tasks.
You can think of these guides as being like a combination of [runbooks and playbooks](https://www.minware.com/guide/best-practices/runbooks-and-playbooks-1).

Our guides are organized by a progression of the kinds of tasks you need to do with your FRAME machine:

- [Day 0](./day-0/README.md) (planning):
  You can simplify the process of deploying a FRAME machine by making some plans and decisions before deployment.
  These guides will help you to make those plans and decisions.

- [Day 1](./day-1/README.md) (deployment):
  When you need to deploy a new FRAME machine, or when you need to re-deploy a FRAME machine into a different operating environment, these guides will help you to perform that deployment smoothly and with less stress.
