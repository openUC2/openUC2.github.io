## 9. **Common Controller Functions**

Each controller in the `uc2-esp32` firmware typically implements a standardized set of functions: `act()`, `get()`, `setup()`, and `loop()`. These functions define how each controller interacts with the system, handles commands, and maintains its state. This common structure ensures consistency across different modules, making it easier to manage and extend the firmware.

### 9.1 **`setup()` Function**

- **Purpose**: The `setup()` function is called during the initialization phase of the firmware. Its primary role is to configure the controller and prepare it for operation. This may involve setting up hardware peripherals, initializing communication interfaces, and configuring initial parameters.

- **Typical Activities**:
  - Initializing GPIO pins or communication protocols (e.g., I2C, SPI).
  - Setting default values for configuration parameters.
  - Establishing initial connections (e.g., WiFi or Bluetooth pairing).
  - Registering the controller with the main control loop.

- **Example Usage**:
  - In a motor controller, `setup()` might configure the motor driver pins and initialize the stepper motor library.
  - For a WiFi controller, `setup()` would configure the WiFi settings and start the connection process.

### 9.2 **`loop()` Function**

- **Purpose**: The `loop()` function is executed continuously in the main loop of the firmware. It handles ongoing tasks and ensures that the controller maintains its operations over time. This function is essential for tasks that require regular updates, such as checking sensor readings or managing ongoing communications.

- **Typical Activities**:
  - Monitoring sensor inputs or checking the status of external devices.
  - Managing continuous output (e.g., adjusting motor position or updating LED brightness).
  - Handling asynchronous events (e.g., receiving data from a WiFi connection).
  - Performing regular checks and maintenance tasks.

- **Example Usage**:
  - In a laser controller, `loop()` could check and maintain the laser's power level and operational state.
  - A PID controller might use `loop()` to constantly read sensor inputs and adjust outputs to maintain the desired state.

### 9.3 **`act()` Function**

- **Purpose**: The `act()` function is called in response to specific commands or actions that need to be taken by the controller. This function processes incoming commands, interprets them, and executes the appropriate actions. It is often invoked based on external inputs or events triggered by other parts of the system.

- **Typical Activities**:
  - Executing a command to move a motor to a specific position.
  - Turning on or off a device like a laser or LED.
  - Changing the configuration settings of the controller (e.g., setting a new target temperature).

- **Example Usage**:
  - In a motor controller, `act()` could be used to receive commands for moving to a specific coordinate and then executing the move.
  - For a WiFi controller, `act()` might handle a command to change the network settings or initiate a data transmission.

### 9.4 **`get()` Function**

- **Purpose**: The `get()` function is used to retrieve the current state or value from the controller. This function provides a way to access real-time data or the current configuration of the controller. It is often used for monitoring, diagnostics, or feedback purposes.

- **Typical Activities**:
  - Returning sensor values or current positions (e.g., the current position of a motor).
  - Providing status information (e.g., connection status of a WiFi module).
  - Accessing configuration parameters or operational states.

- **Example Usage**:
  - In a temperature controller, `get()` could return the current temperature reading.
  - For a laser controller, `get()` might provide information on whether the laser is currently active and at what power level.

### 9.5 **Integration of Common Functions**

These common functions (`act()`, `get()`, `setup()`, and `loop()`) are registered within each controller and integrated into the overall system architecture of the `uc2-esp32` firmware. The `setup()` function is typically called once during initialization, while `loop()` runs continuously. `act()` and `get()` are invoked as needed based on user commands or system events.

By standardizing these functions across different controllers, the firmware achieves modularity and consistency, enabling easier maintenance and extension. Developers can add new controllers or modify existing ones without disrupting the overall system, as long as they adhere to this standardized function interface.


## 10. Serial Interface and Command Syntax

The `uc2-esp32` firmware provides a Serial interface that allows users to communicate with the microcontroller using a standard USB connection. This interface is critical for sending commands, receiving data, and debugging the system. Below, we explain how to formulate and send commands over the Serial interface, focusing on motor control as an example.

### 10.1 Connecting via Serial

To connect to the ESP32 via Serial:

1. Connect the ESP32 to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Open a serial terminal application (e.g., Arduino Serial Monitor, PuTTY, or any other terminal program).
3. Set the correct COM port associated with the ESP32 device.
4. Configure the baud rate (typically 115200 baud for `uc2-esp32`).
5. Set the terminal to use NL (New Line) or CR+LF (Carriage Return + Line Feed) as the line-ending character.

### 10.2 Command Structure

Commands sent over the Serial interface typically follow a JSON format to ensure structured data communication. The JSON format allows

 for easy parsing and flexibility in command structure. Each command consists of a key-value pair where the key indicates the action and the value provides parameters.

#### Example JSON Command:

```json
{
  "command": "motor_move",
  "axis": "z",
  "position": 1000,
  "speed": 500
}
```

### 10.3 Common Serial Commands
