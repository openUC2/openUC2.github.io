# Example Projects

## Learning materials

These projects come with assembly guides, tutorials, and explanations.

- [Spectrometer](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-Spectrometer): for measuring the spectral components of light.
- Educational kits:
  - [Fourier Optics & Course Box](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-GIT/tree/master/TheBOX/CourseBOX)

## Proofs-of-concept

These are technical demonstrations varying levels of documentation.

- [Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM)](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-STORM-and-Fluorescence): for imaging below the diffraction limit by sequentially activating individual fluorescent molecules and precisely localizing them.
- [Optical Sectioning with Structured Illumination Microscopy (OS-SIM)](./os-sim/README.md): for optical sectioning with a digital micromirror device (DMD) to remove out-of-focus blur and improve image contrast.
- [Multi-Camera Capture Demo](https://github.com/openUC2/openUC2_MultiCam): for capturing still frames from up to 8 USB webcams on Linux.
