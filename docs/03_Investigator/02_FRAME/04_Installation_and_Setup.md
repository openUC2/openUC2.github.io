*add the laser cover at the side*

![](./IMAGES/04/FRAME_Manual_26.jpeg)
*Secure the laser cover by snapping it in place*

### Safety Mechanisms

The FRAME incorporates three primary safety systems:

1. **Sample Lid Interlock**:
   - Laser-blocking lid with integrated safety switch
   - Must be properly positioned to activate laser systems
   - Prevents light from escaping through the objective lens

2. **Key Switch Interlock**:
   - Physical key switch that must be activated to enable laser operation
   - Provides positive control over laser activation

3. **Internal Interlocks**:
   - Monitors proper positioning of laser cover and internal components
   - Automatically disables laser if components are not properly installed

### Safety Procedures

**Before Operating with Lasers:**
1. Familiarize yourself with all safety features
2. Ensure all interlocks are functional
3. Verify proper assembly of all safety components
4. Check for any reflective surfaces in the beam path
5. Ensure proper ventilation and lighting in work area

**Emergency Procedures:**
- In case of power loss or interlock interruption, lasers automatically shut down
- Use the key switch to clear interlocks after addressing any safety issues
- Contact support if any safety mechanism appears damaged


### Laser Module Installation Procedures

## Optical Alignment and Calibration

## Optical Alignment and Calibration

Proper optical alignment is critical for optimal system performance. The FRAME system requires alignment of multiple optical components to achieve proper imaging quality.

### Overview of Alignment Process

The optical alignment involves three main steps:
1. **Internal Optics Cube Preparation** - Align the removable optics cube outside the FRAME
2. **FRAME Integration** - Align the cube's optical axis with the FRAME system
3. **Final Verification** - Test and validate all optical paths

### Detailed Alignment Procedures

Complete step-by-step optical alignment procedures are provided in:

📁 **Reference Document**: [`config_examples/Optical_Alignment_Procedures.md`](./config_examples/Optical_Alignment_Procedures.md)

This document covers:
- Internal optics cube preparation and Köhler illumination setup
- Mechanical alignment using adjustment screws
- FRAME integration and axis alignment
- LED alignment tool setup and usage
- Position storage and calibration
- Troubleshooting common alignment issues

### Quick Alignment Summary

1. **Prepare Internal Cube**:
   - Remove cube from FRAME
   - Set up external alignment fixture
   - Align fluorescence path for Köhler illumination
   - Center laser beam exit from objective

2. **FRAME Integration**:
   - Install LED alignment tool
   - Align Y-axis using cube adjustment screws
   - Align X-axis using electronic positioning
   - Store objective positions in EPROM

3. **Verification**:
   - Test both transmitted and fluorescence paths
   - Verify image quality and uniformity
   - Confirm objective switching accuracy


## Stage Coordinate System and Calibration

The FRAME uses a well-defined coordinate system for precise positioning. Complete details about the coordinate system, calibration procedures, and reference points are provided in:

📁 **Reference Document**: [`config_examples/Coordinate_System_Reference.md`](./config_examples/Coordinate_System_Reference.md)

### Key Points:

- **Origin Position**: Corresponds to multiwell plate position A1
- **Calibration Point**: Center reference at xy = 63.5/46 mm
- **Maximum Travel**: 127 x 86 mm (suitable for multiwell plates)

*Coordinate system directions and axis orientations*





### Step 1: Illumination Alignment

**Note: This section is under development. Complete procedures will be provided in future updates.**

**Transmitted Light Setup**:
   - Center LED illumination for uniform field coverage
   - Adjust condenser position for optimal focus (currently only one position - move the LED double cube module along the optical axis so that the brightfield LED is collimated)
   - Plexiglass insert will ensure that darkfield/phase contrast rings will pass through
   - Verify field uniformity across entire viewing area on the camera (if not homogeneous, the objective slot positions need to be recalibrated)


### Step 2: Focus System Calibration

**Note: Complete calibration procedures are under development.**

- System currently does not have an encoder, so it's wise to home the positions periodically to maintain absolute positioning capabilities
- The system does not track lost steps (e.g., when the stage runs into an endstop and slips steps)
- Execute focus system homing sequence using the home button in the main GUI
- **Coming soon:** Set appropriate software travel limits (via the `config.json`)
- Test and verify autofocus functionality (using the button in the main GUI)

### Step 3: Camera Alignment

1. **Camera Installation Verification**:
   - Confirm secure camera mounting to interface
   - Verify data cable connections
   - Test camera software recognition (MVS Software from HIK Robotics / Galaxy Viewer from Daheng Imaging on your host computer)
   - Verify proper image acquisition

2. **Optical Alignment Verification**:
   - Center camera field of view with optical axis
   - Adjust back focal distance for optimal focus
   - Verify image sharpness across entire field
   - Calibrate pixel size and magnification factors



### Step 2: Software Testing

1. **Basic Functions**:
   - Test image acquisition
   - Verify stage control
   - Test focus control
   - Check illumination control

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Test automation sequences
   - Verify remote access
   - Check data export functions
   - Test user interface responsiveness


## Customization Options

### Customize the Objective Holder

**Note: Customization procedures are under development.**

The FRAME system supports custom objective holders for specialized applications. Contact support for custom configurations.

### Customize the Optical Layers

**Note: Layer customization procedures are under development.**

The modular cube system allows for custom optical configurations. Detailed procedures for creating custom optical layers will be provided in future documentation updates.

In a nutshell: the different layers of the FRAME can be constructed freely upon users needs. The current version has a 3x3x3 inner cube, but it can be adjusted to be longer in the Y direction (e.g. 3x5xN) and in the Z-direction by stacking additional layers and increasing outer pillars' height. The below layers demonstrate how a brightfield imaging setup with a simple folding mirror, a tube lens and a camera can be constructed. Additionally we have a fluorescence layer with a fiber holder, the optics to shape the beam and the kinematic dichroic to focus it in the back focal plane from the imaging objective.
