# Professional Line

openUC2's Professional Line instruments are pre-assembled modular imaging systems which are easy to adapt, reconfigure, and extend to meet your research needs:

## FRAME

The [FRAME](./frame/README.md) microscope is a fully-automatable XYZ scanning microscope capable of advanced imaging techniques.

The FRAME consists of:
- A **chassis** which provides XYZ motion and objective switching.
- An **optical engine** which provides the FRAME's optical capabilities, consisting of openUC2 optical modules with a mechanical adapter for integration into the FRAME chassis.
- A **control module** which controls the chassis and the optical engine for image acquisition.

## miniFRAME

The [miniFRAME](./miniframe/README.md) microscope is a compact optical workbench designed for affordable rapid prototyping of advanced imaging systems.

The miniFRAME consists of:
- An **optical engine**, consisting of openUC2 optical modules with mechanical adapters for standalone operation and modular extension without a FRAME chassis.
- A miniaturized **sample stage** which provides limited XYZ motion.
- A **control module** which controls the sample stage and the optical engine for image acquisition.

Because the miniFRAME's optical engine has the same mechanical architecture as the FRAME, a miniFRAME can easily be upgraded into a full FRAME by adding a FRAME chassis and then replacing the miniFRAME's control module with a FRAME control module.
