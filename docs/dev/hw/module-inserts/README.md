# Module Inserts


We try to keep UC2 as open as possible. One important step is to give you the tools at hand to create your own module insert in Order to add own functionalities, parts, modules, etc.
This repository should help you creating inserts and understand the core idea behind the shape and how it can be used to add e.g. lenses, mirros, motors.

If you have a more complex idea for a module, say a rotating diffuser, please feel free to reach out to us! We are happy to support your research with open-source tools!

A good resource is also the [***Module Developer Kit (MDK)***](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-GIT/tree/master/MDK) that summarizes the core concept of UC2's modularity.


***What you will see here:***

* UC2 Cube Inserts
* Design files for
	* Autodesk Inventor
	* OpenSCAD
	* Fusion360
	* STP- and STL-files
* Technical drawings to replicate module in e.g. metal?
* Tutorial to design your modules in Autodesk

This project is open-source and is released under the CERN open hardware license. Our aim is to make the kits commercially available.
We encourage everyone who is using our Toolbox to share their results and ideas, so that the Toolbox keeps improving. It should serve as a easy-to-use and easy-to-access general purpose building block solution for the area of STEAM education. All the design files are generally for free, but we would like to hear from you how is it going.

You're free to fork the project and enhance it. If you have any suggestions to improve it or add any additional functions make a pull-request or file an issue.
