# Day 1: Deployment

If you're setting up a FRAME machine for the first time, you're in the right place— welcome! In these hands-on tutorials, we will:
1. unpack and set up your FRAME so that you can use it
2. connect your computer to your FRAME and access the FRAME's software
3. determine whether your FRAME hardware is fully operational, with no damage during shipping and delivery
4. acquire data using your FRAME for the first time
5. set up remote assistance so that you can receive direct help with your FRAME from openUC2 customer support

Along the way, we will encounter some of your FRAME's web browser apps.

We don't have to finish all of these tutorials within exactly one day!

If your FRAME hardware wasn't damaged during shipping, then we can finish these tutorials in less than a few hours; and we can continue to the [day-2 tutorials](../day-2/README.md) afterwards.

But if you're busy, we can instead do the day-1 tutorials across multiple days.
