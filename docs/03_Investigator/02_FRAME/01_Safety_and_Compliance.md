# Safety and Compliance

## CE Compliance Declaration

The FRAME Microscopes have been designed, produced and tested in compliance with:
- **DIN EN 61010-1 (IEC 61010-1)** - Safety requirements for electrical measuring, control and laboratory instruments
- **IEC 61010-2-101** - Safety requirements for electrical equipment for measurement, control and laboratory use
- **EC Directive IVDD 98/79/EC** - In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices

The instruments meet the requirements and are marked with the **CE** mark.

ToDo Armin 250731: CE mark not yet on the FRAME, correct?

## Important Safety Information

**Knowledge of this manual is required for the operation of the instrument.** Please make yourself familiar with the contents of this manual and pay special attention to hints concerning safe operation of the instrument.

## General Safety Precautions

### Electrical Safety

1. **Power Supply**: Ensure the power supply voltage matches the instrument specifications and your country's requirements (e.g. 230V vs 115V)
2. **Electrical Connections**: Ensure all electrical connections are secure and dry
3. **Service**: Do not attempt to service electrical components unless qualified. Reach out to support@openuc2.com or write in our forum openuc2.discourse.group

### Optical Safety

1. **UV Protection**: When using UV illumination sources:
   - Wear appropriate UV-blocking safety glasses
   - Avoid direct eye exposure to UV light
   - Ensure proper ventilation in the work area

2. **Laser Safety** (if applicable, see later also laser safety chapter):
   - Follow all applicable laser safety regulations
   - Use appropriate laser safety eyewear
   - Post appropriate warning signs

3. **High-Intensity Light Sources**:
   - Avoid looking directly into high-intensity light sources
   - Use appropriate neutral density filters when necessary

### Mechanical Safety

1. **Moving Parts**: Keep hands and loose clothing away from moving parts
2. **Sample Handling**: Use appropriate tools when handling samples
3. **Weight**: Use proper lifting techniques when moving the microscope (~20kg)
4. **Sharp Edges**: Be aware of sharp edges on optical components and mounts
5. **Rapid Prototyping**: Customize optical systems
