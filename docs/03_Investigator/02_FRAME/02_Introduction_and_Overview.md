# Introduction and Overview

## What is the FRAME Microscope?

The **FRAME** (Fast Rigid Automated Microscope Engine) represents a new approach to microscopy: an open, modular, automated, and flexibly adaptable microscope system. Based on UC2's (You.See.Too.) modular optics kit, the FRAME system lowers barriers to access complex optical and microscopy technology.

## System Philosophy

### Modular Design Principles

The FRAME system is built on complete modularization of all components regarding mechanics, electronics, and software:

- **Interchangeable Modules**: Cube modules can be freely exchanged to switch between brightfield, fluorescence, or interference microscopy
- **Flexible Mechanics**: Allows both, classical objective setups and free arrangements for special geometries
- **Smart Electronics**: Each cube can optionally have its own control unit for motors, galvo mirrors, or LEDs. All components share the same CAN BUS via 12V supply voltage.
- **Open Interface**: System control via user-friendly graphical interface or programming interface (Python, REST, CAN BUS, USB)


### Key Innovation Areas

1. **Accessibility**: Open-source hardware and software increase transparency, longevity, and interoperability
2. **Automation**: Open system allows straightforward automation with built-in APIs for software control, camera integration, and laboratory automation
3. **Modularity**: Instead of purchasing a completely new microscope, users can exchange or expand individual modules
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Compared to proprietary complete systems, costs are reduced by 50-90% depending on configuration

## Sustainability and Environmental Impact

### Resource Conservation

The modular approach contributes to sustainability on multiple levels:

1. **Repair & Maintenance**: Instead of disposing of complete systems, only individual modules are replaced or adapted
2. **Upgrading**: When components become outdated or new functions are needed, individual modules can be upgraded rather than replacing the entire system
3. **Local Production**: Many mechanical components are produced locally via 3D printing using renewable materials

### Open Source Benefits

- **Global Accessibility**: Electronic platforms can be replicated worldwide, including in resource-limited regions
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Open documentation promotes global access to high technology
- **Community Development**: Active community ensures continuous improvement and support
- **Local Repairs**: Using 3D printing and digital fabrication, broken parts can be repaired on site
