## Introduction 
The CoreBOX is our base educational product and focuses on 3 things:

1. **Basic Optics understanding:** Helping students to understand and experience basic optics.
2. **Basic Microscopy understanding:** Helping students to understand and experience first microscopic experiments.
3. **Basic UC2 component understanding:** Deliver an understanding of our cube system as a base to build more complex setups with our more sophisticated boxes.

## Part 1: Basic Optical Experiments

### Overview: Which experiments are possible?

The experiments are split in two groups: **Optics & Microscopy**. With the parts included in the CoreBOX, at least 8 experiments can be performed.

| Optics                          | Microscopy                                   |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Magnifying Glass                | Microscope 1: Infinity Microscope            |
| Focal Lengths                   | Microscope 2: Finite Microscope with Z-Stage |
| Projector                       | Microscope 3: Smartphone Microscope          |
| Telescope 1: Galilean Telescope |                                              |
| Telescope 2: Kepler Telescope   |                                              |


### Experiment 1: Magnifying Glass

#### NECESSARY PARTS
50mm lens

#### SETUP
This is very simple and does not have a real setup at all. Students take out one of the 50mm lenses and look through it.

#### GOAL:
In this experiment students see, how a lens magnifies what they look at.

### Experiment 2: Focal Lengths

#### NECESSARY PARTS

- 50mm lens
- 100mm lens
- 50mm lens


#### SETUP

Now we need two more lenses, but still there is no assembly needed.The student choose a fixed geometry, for example a letter on the user-guide card and look at it through the different lenses


#### GOAL:

Students should realise how the different focal lengths impact what they see through the lens. This understanding is the base to understand how the distance between different lenses affects the setups we will build later.
