# Machine Connectivity

The how-to guides here will help you to:
- access your FRAME's software
- make your FRAME's software easy to access

This process will be less stressful for you if you've already done [the relevant day-0 planning](../../day-0/connectivity/README.md).

## How to connect to the FRAME

To choose which of the following methods you will use for connecting to the FRAME, refer to our guide for [how to choose a networking topology](../../day-0/connectivity/README.md#how-to-choose-a-networking-topology).

### directly

#### via a USB-C cable

1. If your computer runs Windows, then you will first need to install [Raspberry Pi's NDIS driver](https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-usb-gadget/releases/latest) on your computer.

   Afterwards, you should see a network adapter named "Raspberry Pi USB Remote NDIS Network Device" in Windows's list of network adapters.

2. Plug one end of a USB-C data cable (not a charging-only cable!) into the RPi's dedicated USB-C port.

3. Plug the other end of the USB-C cable into a USB-C port on your computer.

   If your computer doesn't have a USB-C port, then you can use a USB-C-to-USB-A adapter.

4. After around 5 to 10 seconds, your computer should indicate that it now has a wired connection.

#### via an Ethernet cable

1. Plug one end of an Ethernet cable into the RPi's built-in Ethernet port.

2. Plug the other end of the Ethernet cable into your computer's Ethernet port.

   If your computer doesn't have an Ethernet port, then you can instead plug the other end of the Ethernet cable into an Ethernet-to-USB adapter which you can plug into your computer's USB port.

3. After around 10 to 15 seconds, your computer should indicate that it now has a wired connection.

#### via the FRAME's Wi-Fi hotspot

1. On your computer, connect to the FRAME's Wi-Fi hotspot. When prompted, enter the password for the FRAME's Wi-Fi hotspot.
2. After a while, your computer should indicate that it is now connected to the FRAME's Wi-Fi hotspot.

### indirectly

#### via Tailscale

1. [Set up remote access for the FRAME through your own Tailscale tailnet](#through-your-own-tailscale-tailnet).
2. [Connect your FRAME to the internet](#how-to-connect-the-frame-to-the-internet).
3. [Add your own computer to your Tailscale tailnet](https://tailscale.com/docs/install).
4. Connect your computer to the internet.
5. Activate your computer's connection to the tailnet with your FRAME.
6. Ensure that your tailnet doesn't have any security policies which would prevent your computer from connecting to the FRAME.

#### via a Local Area Network

1. Connect your FRAME to a Local Area Network (LAN) by following the same procedure you would use to [connect your FRAME to the internet](#how-to-connect-the-frame-to-the-internet) via a network router or external Wi-Fi network.
2. Connect your computer to the same LAN.

## How to access the FRAME's landing page

The following factors will determine which access methods work for you:

- The [networking topology](../../day-0/connectivity/README.md#how-to-choose-a-networking-topology) you've selected.
- The specific way in which you're [connecting your computer to the FRAME](#how-to-connect-to-the-frame).
- Your operating system's settings, and its mDNS support.
- Your web browser's DNS settings, and its mDNS support.

If none of the following access methods work in your situation, please contact openUC2 customer support for help.

### via a generic domain name

:::info

This method may result in surprising behaviors if your computer is [connected to multiple FRAME machines](../../day-0/connectivity/README.md#for-multiple-frame-machines); in such scenarios, you should instead use [a machine-specific domain name](#via-a-machine-specific-domain-name).

:::

1. [Connect to the FRAME](#how-to-connect-to-the-frame).

2. In your computer's web browser, try opening the FRAME's landing page at <http://openuc2.local>.

   :::info

   On Windows, you may need to first [install Apple's Bonjour](https://support.apple.com/en-us/106380) in order to use `openuc2.local`.

   :::

   If that doesn't work, try opening <http://open.uc2> instead.

   :::info

   `open.uc2` only works for [direct connections to FRAME machines](#directly).

   :::

3. If none of these domain names work, try accessing the landing page [via a machine-specific domain name](#via-a-machine-specific-domain-name) instead.

4. Confirm that the machine name reported at the top of the landing page matches the name of your FRAME machine.

   If the machine names don't match, then the generic domain name has been reserved by some other FRAME machine.
   Try accessing the landing page [via your FRAME's machine-specific domain name](#via-a-machine-specific-domain-name) instead.

### via a machine-specific domain name

Assuming your machine's name is `{machine name}`,

1. [Connect to the FRAME](#how-to-connect-to-the-frame).

2. In your computer's web browser, try opening the FRAME's landing page at `http://openuc2-{machine name}.local`.

   :::info

   On Windows, you may need to first [install Apple's Bonjour](https://support.apple.com/en-us/106380) in order to use `openuc2-{machine name}.local`.

   :::

   If that doesn't work, try opening `http://{machine name}.uc2` instead.

   :::info

   `{machine name}.uc2` only works for [direct connections to FRAME machines](#directly).

   :::

3. If none of these domain names work and you're connected to the FRAME directly, try accessing the landing page [via a static IP address](#via-a-static-ip-address) instead.

### via a static IP address

:::info

The FRAME's static IP addresses only work for [direct connections to FRAME machines](#directly).

:::

1. [Connect to the FRAME directly](#directly).

2. In your computer's web browser, try opening the FRAME's landing page using the static IP address specific to the network connection method you used for connecting to the FRAME:
   1. If you're connected [via the FRAME's Wi-Fi hotspot](#via-the-frames-wi-fi-hotspot), try opening <http://192.168.4.1>.
   2. If you're connected [via an Ethernet cable](#via-an-ethernet-cable), try opening <http://192.168.5.1>.
   3. If you're connected [via a USB-C cable](#via-a-usb-c-cable), try opening <http://192.168.6.1>.

4. Confirm that the machine name reported at the top of the landing page matches the name of your FRAME machine.

   If the machine name doesn't match, then you've connected to some other FRAME machine.
   Go to the troubleshooting guide at TODO.

### via a Tailscale MagicDNS domain name

:::info

MagicDNS only works for [Tailscale connections to FRAME machines](#via-tailscale).

:::

1. [Set up a Tailscale connection from your computer to the FRAME](#via-tailscale).
2. [Enable MagicDNS](https://tailscale.com/docs/features/magicdns#enabling-magicdns) on your tailnet.
3. In your computer's web browser, try entering the FRAME machine's MagicDNS domain name (which should have the format `openuc2-{machine name}.{tailnet DNS name}`, e.g. `openuc2-cool-machine-1234.cool-breeze.ts.net`).

## How to connect the FRAME to the internet

To choose which of the following methods you will use for giving the FRAME internet access, refer to our guide for [how to choose a networking topology](../../day-0/connectivity/README.md#how-to-choose-a-networking-topology).

### via an Ethernet connection to a network router

1. [Connect your computer directly to the FRAME](#directly).

2. Plug one end of an Ethernet cable into the RPi's Ethernet port.

3. Plug the other end of the Ethernet cable into an Ethernet port which is connected to the network router.

4. In your computer's web browser, open the Machine Administration app from [the FRAME's landing page](#how-to-access-the-frames-landing-page).

5. Open the Internet Access page.

6. Check the status of the `eth0` module at the bottom of the page.
   If it's connected to the router, then its connectivity status will be listed as "full" to indicate that the network router seems to provide internet access to the RPi.

   If you instead see a "limited" connectivity status, then the network router may be blocking internet access to the RPi; or if you see a "none" connectivity status, then the network router may be blocking the RPi.
   In either case, you'll need to ask for help from someone who manages the security settings for the network you're trying to access.

If you need to know the MAC address of your RPi's Ethernet module in order to register your RPi with the network router, you can see the MAC address by expanding the "Other" panel of the `eth0` module information card on the Internet Access page.

### via an external Wi-Fi network

1. [Connect your computer directly to the FRAME](#directly).

2. In your computer's web browser, open the Machine Administration app from [the FRAME's landing page](#how-to-access-the-frames-landing-page).

3. Open the Internet Access page.

4. In the "External Wi-Fi network" section, configure a Wi-Fi network for the FRAME to connect to:

   1. Select the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to in the "Network" dropdown menu.

      If it's not listed, press the "Rescan" button above the dropdown menu to refresh the menu.

      If it's still not listed, select the "(other: specify below)" option, and then type in the exact name of the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to.

   2. Either enter the Wi-Fi network's password or select the "No password" option.

   3. If you want the FRAME to automatically connect to the network whenever it's available, then select the "Always connect when available" radio button.

      Otherwise, you'll have to press the "Save and connect" button below whenever you want the FRAME to connect to the network.

   4. Press the "Save and connect" button. The RPi will connect to the Wi-Fi network.

If you need to know the MAC address of your RPi's Ethernet module in order to register your RPi with the network router, you can see the MAC address by expanding the "Other" panel of the `wlan1` module information card on the Internet Access page.

#### with a captive portal

If the Wi-Fi network has a captive portal, you will first need to interact with the captive portal in order for the FRAME to receive internet access from the network:

1. Connect your FRAME [to the Wi-Fi network](#via-an-external-wi-fi-network), if you haven't already done so.

2. [Connect your computer to the FRAME](#how-to-connect-to-the-frame), if you haven't already done so.

3. Disconnect your computer from any networks which might directly give it internet access.

4. Open the captive portal from your computer's web browser by trying to open a normal webpage which requires internet access, such as <https://google.com>.

   If the captive portal doesn't load that way, you'll instead need to open the specific URL of the captive portal's webpage.

5. Fill out the form on the captive portal, if it requires you to do so in order to receive internet access.

6. Confirm that your FRAME now has internet access by trying to open a normal webpage from your computer's web browser, such as <http://google.com>.

Afterwards, you can connect your computer back to any networks which might directly give it internet access.

## How to set up remote access

### for remote assistance from openUC2

1. [Connect your computer directly to the FRAME](#directly).

2. [Connect the FRAME to the internet](#how-to-connect-the-frame-to-the-internet).

3. In your computer's web browser, open the Machine Administration app from [the FRAME's landing page](#how-to-access-the-frames-landing-page).

4. In the Machine Administration app, open the Remote Access page.

5. If the status of the remote-access agent is "needs login", then in the "Remote assistance" section you should paste in the device authentication key given to you by openUC2 customer support.

  Otherwise, if the status is "stopped" and a domain name is listed in the format `openuc2-{machine name}.queue-macaroni.ts.net`, then you don't need to paste in a device authentication key.

  Otherwise, if the status is "running" and the network listed is not `openuc2-gmbh.github`, then you will need to first disable remote assistance and then paste in a device authentication key given to you by openUC2 customer support.

6. In the "Remote assistance" section, press the "Enable" button.

### through your own Tailscale tailnet

1. [Connect your FRAME machine to the internet](#how-to-connect-the-frame-to-the-internet).

2. If you don't already have a Tailscale tailnet, [create one](https://tailscale.com/docs/how-to/quickstart#create-a-tailnet).

3. Add your FRAME machine to your Tailscale tailnet:
   1. In your web browser, open the Tailscale Admin Console's [Add Linux server page](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines/new-linux).

   2. Click the "Generate install script" or "Re-generate install script" button at the bottom of the page.

   3. Copy the resulting setup command, which will look something like:
      ```
      curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh && sudo tailscale up --auth-key=tskey-auth-something-random
      ```

   4. [Connect your computer directly to the FRAME](#directly).

   5. In your computer's web browser, open the Machine Administration app from [the FRAME's landing page](#how-to-access-the-frames-landing-page).

   6. In the Machine Administration app, open the Remote Access page.

   7. If remote asssistance is already enabled (e.g. over the `openuc2-gmbh.github` network for [receiving remote assistance from openUC2 customer support](#for-remote-assistance-from-openuc2)), then you will need to disable it.

   8. Paste in the Tailscale setup command as the device authentication key, and press the "Enable" button.

   9. Confirm that the remote-access agent's status is reported as "running" and that its connectivity is reported as "connected".

      If it is not connected, then the network providing access to your FRAME machine may be blocking Tailscale.

:::info

As long as your FRAME is connected to your own tailnet instead of the `openuc2-gmbh.github` remote-access network, openUC2 customer support will not be able to access your FRAME for providing remote assistance.
