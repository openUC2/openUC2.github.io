# Light Sheet Box

The Light Sheet Box enables you to build an advanced fluorescence microscopy system that illuminates only a thin slice of your specimen. This technique allows for fast, gentle, and high-contrast 3D imaging of biological samples.

## What is Light Sheet Microscopy?

Light sheet microscopy illuminates the sample perpendicular to the detection axis using a thin sheet of laser light. Only the focal plane is illuminated while all other regions remain dark, which:
- Reduces photobleaching and phototoxicity
- Increases imaging speed dramatically
- Provides excellent optical sectioning
- Enables 3D reconstruction through z-stack imaging

## How it Works

A laser beam is expanded and shaped using a cylindrical lens to create a thin light sheet that passes through the sample perpendicular to the microscope's optical axis. The objective lens views the illuminated plane from the side, capturing only fluorescence from the thin illuminated section. By moving the sample through the light sheet in small increments, you can acquire a complete 3D volume.
