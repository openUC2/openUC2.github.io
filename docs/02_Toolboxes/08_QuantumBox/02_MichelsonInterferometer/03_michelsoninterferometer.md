# Tutorial: Building a Michelson Interferometer

In this workshop, we will construct a Michelson Interferometer using the UC2 modular microscope toolbox. The Michelson Interferometer is a device that measures the interference properties of light and has been fundamental in advancing our understanding of the nature of light and space-time. We will treat light as a wave with very high frequency and use it to perform fascinating experiments that demonstrate wave optics principles.

### Theory of Operation

A Michelson Interferometer splits a laser beam into two equal parts using a beam splitter. The two beams are then reflected by mirrors and recombined to interfere with each other. When the paths of the two beams are equal, they constructively interfere, resulting in a bright output. However, if one path is shifted by 1/4 of the wavelength, the beams destructively interfere, resulting in a dark output.

The Michelson Interferometer operates as a two-beam interference device where coherent light is divided into reference and sample arms. The beam splitter acts as both a divider and combiner, sending half the light to each arm and then recombining the reflected beams. The interference pattern depends on the optical path difference between the two arms, making it extremely sensitive to small distance changes.

In ray optics, light is represented as a bundle of rays (arrows), which entails a simplification pf the physical properties of light. The arrow indicates the direction of the beam direction/light. The beam splitter divides the light in to two different directions in t terms of magnitude. Here i is important how the beam splitter is built into the cube.

if we extend the beam splitter by to mirrors the split light is reflected back to them. the consequence that the two parts of the light unite again and form a new wave. This is called Interference.

### Theoretical Background

**Interference Principles**

Interference is a phenomenon that occurs when two or more waves overlap in space and combine their amplitudes. When waves are in-phase (their crests and troughs align), they constructively interfere, resulting in a larger amplitude. When they are out of phase (their crests and troughs are misaligned), they destructively interfere, resulting in a smaller or zero amplitude. Interference is a fundamental concept in wave physics and plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of light.

**Wave Superposition and Path Difference**
![](./IMAGES/wave.png)

The fundamental principle underlying interferometry is the superposition of electromagnetic waves. When two coherent light beams recombine, the resulting intensity follows:

$$
I = I_1 + I_2 + 2\sqrt{I_1 I_2}\cos(\Delta\varphi)
$$

Where $$\Delta\varphi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\Delta L$$ is the phase difference corresponding to path difference $$\Delta L$$.



**Sensitivity and Measurement Principles**

The key principle behind the Michelson Interferometer is wave superposition. When two coherent light waves with the same frequency but different phases combine, the resulting intensity depends on their phase relationship:
- Constructive interference (bright fringes): Path difference $$= n\lambda$$ (where n is an integer)
- Destructive interference (dark fringes): Path difference $$= (n + 1/2)\lambda$$

**Coherence Requirements**


For stable interference patterns, the light source must exhibit both spatial and temporal coherence:
- **Temporal coherence**: The wave trains must maintain phase relationships over time scales relevant to the path difference
- **Spatial coherence**: The wavefronts must be sufficiently uniform across the beam cross-section
- **Coherence length**: Lc = λ²/Δλ, where Δλ is the spectral width of the source

### Historical Context and Significance

The Michelson Interferometer was invented by Albert Michelson in 1881 and played a crucial role in:
- **Michelson-Morley experiment (1887)**: Disproved the existence of luminiferous aether, paving the way for Einstein's special relativity
- **Precision measurement of the speed of light**: Earning Michelson the 1907 Nobel Prize in Physics
- **Definition of the meter**: Originally defined in terms of wavelengths of krypton-86 radiation using interferometric measurements


**Modern Applications**

The Michelson Interferometer remains an essential tool in modern optics and has found applications in diverse fields:
- **LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory)**: Uses kilometer-scale Michelson interferometers to detect gravitational waves
- **Precision metrology**: Measuring distances with nanometer accuracy
- **Spectroscopy**: Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
- **Surface profiling**: Measuring surface roughness and topography
- **Optical coherence tomography (OCT)**: Medical imaging applications

### Extended Tutorial: Aligning the Michelson Interferometer

#### 1: Align and Observe the Interference

After the complete Assembly, remove the lens and turn the laser on. You will now see two beam spots, one from each mirror. Adjust the movable mirror angles with the screwdriver so that the two beamspots overlap as much as possible.

![](./IMAGES/image67.jpg)
![](./IMAGES/image115.jpg)
![](./IMAGES/image88.jpg)


#### 2. Observe the Interference Pattern

Reinsert the lens. You will see two extended beams. Adjust the reference mirror screws to overlap the beams perfectly. You will see the interference pattern emerging. Then try to center the pattern on the screen. Turn the laser off.
For problems look at the **troubleshooting guide** on the end of this page.

### Optional Tutorial: Camera setup

#### 1. Set up the Camera

remove the screen and place the camera behind the beam splitter and fix it with the base plates. Connect it to the computer and open the MV Software. To check the MVS tutorial click [here](https://openuc2.github.io/docs/Electronics/HIKCamera/SoftwareTutorial).

#### 2 Adjust the Camera Exposure

Adjust the exposure time of the camera. You should see a fringe pattern. Try to adjust the reference mirror screws finely to bring the center of the interference pattern to the center of the camera.

## Experiment 1: Basic Interference Pattern Observation

### 1.1: Observe Static Interference

Turn on the laser and observe the interference pattern on the screen or camera. Document the circular fringe pattern (Newton's rings) that results from the interference of two slightly divergent beams.

![](./IMAGES/IMG_20230812_144849.jpg)

*Picture of older setup with camera - Fully assembled UC2 interferometer with green laser diode, camera, beamsplitter, kinematic mirror and translatable mirror*

### 1.2: Record the Pattern

Using the camera, capture images of the interference pattern. Note the bright and dark fringes and their spacing.

![](./IMAGES/IMG_20230812_144127.jpg)

*Picture of older setup with camera - Newton rings interference pattern showing circular fringes from two overlapping spherical wavefronts*

## Experiment 2: Path Difference Measurement (for camera-setup only)

### 2.1: Translate the Mirror

Carefully move the variable mirror using the fine adjustment screws. Observe how the fringe pattern changes as you alter the path difference.

### 2.2: Count Fringe Shifts

Count the number of bright fringes that pass a fixed point as you move the mirror. Each fringe corresponds to a path difference change of one wavelength (λ ≈ 532 nm for green light).

![](./IMAGES/IMG_20230812_144857.jpg)

*Picture of older setup with camera - Quantitative measurement using ESP32 camera to track beam motion and measure distances*

### 2.3: Calculate Distance Moved

Use the relationship:
$$
\text{Distance moved} = \frac{\text{Number of fringes} \times \lambda}{2}
$$
The factor of 2 accounts for the double pass through the moving arm.

## Experiment 3: Coherence Length Measurement (for camera-setup only)


### 3.1: Find Visibility Limits

Gradually increase the path difference between the two arms until the fringe visibility decreases significantly.

### 3.2: Measure Coherence Length

The coherence length is approximately equal to the path difference at which the fringe visibility drops to 1/e of its maximum value.

### 3.3: Calculate Spectral Width

Use the relationship:
$$
\text{Coherence length} = \frac{\lambda^2}{\Delta\lambda}
$$
to estimate the spectral width of your laser.
