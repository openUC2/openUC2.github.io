# HoloBox - Holography and Interferometry

The HoloBox introduces you to the world of interferometry, holography, and polarization optics. Using coherent laser light, you can explore wave phenomena and create interference patterns that reveal the wave nature of light.

## What You'll Learn

- Principles of optical interferometry
- Coherence and interference of light waves
- Split-beam interferometry techniques
- Inline and off-axis holography
- Quantitative phase imaging
- Polarization phenomena

## Interferometry Experiments

### Michelson Interferometer
The classic interferometer that uses a beam splitter to create two separate light paths that are later recombined to create interference patterns. Fundamental for understanding wave optics and measuring optical path differences.

### Mach-Zehnder Interferometer
A split-beam interferometer with separate reference and sample arms, ideal for transmission microscopy and quantitative phase imaging. Offers greater flexibility for sample insertion compared to the Michelson design.

### Inline Holography
Record and reconstruct wavefronts using inline holographic techniques for label-free imaging and 3D reconstruction.

## Polarization Experiments

Explore the polarization properties of light through various experiments demonstrating:
- Crossed polarizers
- Stress birefringence
- Three polarizer paradox
- And more polarization phenomena
