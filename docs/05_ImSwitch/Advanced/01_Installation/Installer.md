## Introduction

The ImSwitch Installer is an Electron-based application designed to streamline the installation process of the ImSwitch environment. It automates the download and setup of a Mamba environment along with all necessary dependencies from GitHub via pip. This tool simplifies the installation process, reducing it to a few clicks and eliminating the need for executing multiple complex commands.

**NEW:** ImSwitch now runs as a web-based application embedded within the installer window. No external browser required.
