# Aligning the Beamsplitter Cube

The new xyz microscope has a special 2x1 cube that holds the fluorescence optics. Inside the beamsplitter cube is mounted kinematically and can be adjusted with 3 set screws. It's important that the fiber coupled laser is focussed / reimaged in the back focal plane of the objective lens. Therefore, we have created a little tutorial to get you starting how this works.
