## Background Physics: Understanding Quantum Spin

### What is "Spin"?

**Quantum spin** is a fundamental property of particles, like electrons, that has no direct classical analogy:

- **Not like spinning tops**: Particles don't actually rotate; spin is purely quantum mechanical
- **Discrete states**: Electrons can only have spin "up" or spin "down" (not in between)
- **Magnetic property**: Spin creates a tiny magnetic field
- **Measurable**: We can detect and manipulate these quantum states

### Electron Spin in Atoms

Every electron has:
1. **Charge** (-1): Creates electric fields
2. **Mass** (very small): Responds to gravitational forces  
3. **Spin** (±1/2): Creates magnetic fields

**In most materials**: Electron spins are paired up (↑↓) and cancel out
**In NV centers**: One electron spin remains unpaired and detectable

### Energy Levels and Transitions

**Quantum energy levels** are like stairs:
- **Ground state**: Lowest energy (most stable)
- **Excited states**: Higher energy (less stable)
- **Transitions**: Energy must be absorbed or emitted to change levels

**Three key energy levels in NV centers**:
1. **Ground state**: Where electrons normally reside
2. **Excited state**: Where electrons go when hit by green laser light
3. **Intermediate states**: Involved in the spin-dependent optical cycle

![NV center energy levels](./IMAGES/image11.png)

### Magnetic Resonance Principle

**Resonance** occurs when:
- **Frequency matches**: Microwave frequency exactly matches energy gap between spin states
- **Energy absorption**: Microwaves flip electron spins
- **Observable change**: Optical properties change when spins flip

**Mathematical relationship**: E = hf
- E: Energy difference between spin states
- h: Planck's constant (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)
- f: Microwave frequency needed for resonance

**Procedure**:
1. **Assemble the base plate configuration** as shown in the diagram
2. **Install the green laser diode** with secure mounting
3. **Position the focusing lens** to concentrate laser light on the diamond
4. **Verify beam alignment** travels parallel to table surface

**Safety reminder**: Keep laser OFF during assembly!

![Basic setup construction](./IMAGES/image13.png)

#### Step 2: Diamond Positioning and Focusing

**Objective**: Optimize laser excitation of the NV center

**Procedure**:
1. **Mount the NV diamond** on the XY-stage
2. **Adjust the XY-stage** to place diamond in the laser focus
3. **Turn laser ON briefly** for alignment
4. **Look through the red filter**: Diamond should glow brightly red
5. **Optimize position** for maximum fluorescence brightness

**What you should observe**:
- **Bright red glow**: Indicates successful NV center excitation
- **Focused spot**: Laser should create a small, intense spot on diamond
- **Even illumination**: No hot spots or irregular patterns

**Scientific explanation**: Green laser light excites electrons in NV centers to higher energy states. When they fall back down, they emit red fluorescence light.

![Diamond positioning and optimization](./IMAGES/image13.png)

### Phase 2: Fluorescence Detection Setup

#### Step 3: Complete the Detection System

**Objective**: Separate excitation light from fluorescence signal

**Procedure**:
1. **Install the beam splitter** in the optical path
2. **Position the 45° mirror** to direct fluorescence to detector
3. **Place the red color filter** before the photodetector
4. **Connect the light sensor** to the control electronics

**Key principle**: The red filter blocks green laser light but allows red fluorescence to pass through, enabling us to measure only the NV center emission.

![Complete detection setup](./IMAGES/image14.png)

#### Step 4: Optimize Detection Sensitivity

**Objective**: Maximize signal from NV center fluorescence

**Procedure**:
1. **Adjust the 45° mirror angle** for maximum light collection
2. **Connect to light sensor interface** on computer

- **Frequency matching**: Only when microwave frequency exactly matches the energy gap will resonance occur

![Microwave system installation](./IMAGES/image15.png)

#### Step 6: Observe Magnetic Field Effects

**Objective**: Detect changes in fluorescence due to magnetic field variations

**Procedure**:
1. **Establish baseline**: Record fluorescence intensity with magnet in fixed position
2. **Move the magnet**: Change magnetic field strength by repositioning magnet
3. **Observe intensity changes**: Look for variations in detected fluorescence
4. **Document observations**: Note relationship between magnet position and signal

**What to expect**:
- **Signal variations**: Fluorescence intensity should change as magnetic field changes
- **Non-linear relationship**: Small magnet movements may cause large signal changes
- **Reproducible effects**: Same magnet positions should give same results

**Physical explanation**: Changing magnetic field alters the energy gap between spin states, affecting the resonance condition and the optical properties of the NV center.

### Phase 4: Magnetic Resonance Detection

**Expected results**:
- **Resonance peaks**: Sharp dips in fluorescence at specific frequencies
- **Frequency dependence**: Resonance frequency changes with magnetic field strength
- **Reproducible**: Same conditions should give same resonance frequencies

**Simplified demonstration** (basic equipment):
1. **Set microwave to known frequency**: Use frequency known to be near resonance
2. **Turn microwaves ON and OFF**: Observe fluorescence with and without microwaves
3. **Look for intensity changes**: Compare fluorescence levels
4. **Adjust magnetic field**: Change field strength and repeat
