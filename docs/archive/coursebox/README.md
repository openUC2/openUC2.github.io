# Fourier Optics & Course Box

The Fourier Optics / Course Box teaches the fundamental principles of microscopy and optical alignment. Originally designed for the "Principles of Light Microscopy" course at the Light Microscopy Facility of MPI-CBG in Dresden, this toolbox provides hands-on experience with the core concepts that make all microscopy methods possible.

## Educational Philosophy

This box is designed for microscopy courses targeting users rather than optical designers. It provides insight into the "black box" that microscopes often seem to be, with comprehensive alignment tutorials using basic components. By reusing components and building from common ground, it demonstrates that all microscopy methods are based on just a few fundamental principles.

## What You'll Learn

- Core principles of light microscopy
- Köhler illumination setup and alignment
- Conjugate planes in microscopy
- Finite vs. infinity-corrected optics
- Fourier transform in optics (Abbe diffraction)
- Practical optical alignment techniques
- Ray diagrams and optical path design

## Experiments in this Section

### 1. Compound Microscope (Finite Optics)
Build a finite-corrected microscope with proper Köhler illumination where all conjugate planes are accessible for learning.

**Learn:** Basic microscope design, Köhler illumination, finite optics, conjugate planes

### 2. Abbe Diffraction Experiment (Finite Optics)
Classical experiment demonstrating the Fourier transform performed by a lens. Simultaneously observe the primary image plane and back focal plane using a beam splitter and relay lens.

**Learn:** Fourier optics, diffraction, spatial frequency filtering, back focal plane imaging

### 3. Compound Microscope (Infinity Optics)
Build an infinity-corrected microscope with proper Köhler illumination, showing how modern microscopes are designed.

**Learn:** Infinity-corrected optics, tube lens function, modern microscope design

### 4. Abbe Diffraction (Infinity Optics)
Reuse the infinity microscope setup with a laser pointer to demonstrate Fourier transform and diffraction principles in infinity-corrected systems.

**Learn:** Laser illumination, diffraction patterns, infinity space manipulation

### 5. Microscopy Alignment Procedures
Detailed step-by-step alignment tutorials for both finite and infinity-corrected microscopes.

**Learn:** Köhler illumination alignment, centering techniques, optical axis alignment
