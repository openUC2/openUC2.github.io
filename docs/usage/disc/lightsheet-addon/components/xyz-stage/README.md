# XYZ Stage

Learn how to build, control, and integrate motorized XYZ stages into your UC2 microscopy system. Motorized stages enable automated scanning, focus stacking, and precise sample positioning.

## Overview

XYZ stages provide three-axis motorized control for:
- **X-axis:** Lateral movement (left/right)
- **Y-axis:** Lateral movement (forward/backward)
- **Z-axis:** Vertical movement (focusing)

These stages are essential for automated microscopy, allowing programmatic control of sample position and focus.

## What You'll Learn

- XYZ stage assembly and wiring
- Stepper motor control principles
- Stage calibration and homing
- Software control via UC2 firmware
- Integration with PS4 controller
- Automated scanning patterns
