# Infinity Box

The Infinity Box explores advanced computational microscopy techniques using the UC2 modular system. This toolbox focuses on sophisticated imaging methods that reveal information invisible to conventional microscopy.

## Featured Technique: Differential Phase Contrast (DPC)

DPC microscopy is a computational imaging technique that uses partial coherent light sources to illuminate samples at various angles. By combining multiple images taken under different illumination conditions, you can extract quantitative phase information and enhance contrast in transparent specimens.
