# Chapter 2: Configuration Management

In [Chapter 1: UC2Client](01_uc2client_.md), we successfully connected to our UC2 device and checked its status. Remember how we typed the IP address directly into our code?

```python
# From Chapter 1
uc2_ip_address = "192.168.1.100" # Hardcoded IP address
client = UC2Client(ip_address=uc2_ip_address)
```

This works fine for a quick test, but imagine:
*   What if your UC2 device gets a new IP address? You'd have to find and change it in your script.
*   What if you want to run the same script for multiple UC2 devices, each with its own IP?
*   What if you want to adjust other settings, like how long the script waits for a response (a "timeout")?

Changing the script every time you want to adjust a setting isn't ideal. This is where **Configuration Management** comes in handy!

## What is Configuration Management?

Think of Configuration Management like the **settings menu** in a video game or a phone app. Instead of the game developers permanently fixing the screen brightness or difficulty level inside the game's core programming, they provide a menu where *you* can change these settings easily.

Similarly, Configuration Management in `UC2-REST` provides a way to handle settings like:
*   The UC2 device's network address (IP address or URL)
*   API keys or credentials (if needed for security)
*   Timeout values (how long to wait for the device to respond)
*   Other customizable options

This allows you to change how the `UC2Client` behaves **without modifying the main Python script**. You just change the "settings menu" (the configuration).

## Using Configuration: A Better Way to Connect

Instead of passing just the IP address directly, `UC2-REST` might allow you to pass settings using a more organized approach, often using a Python dictionary.

**Step 1: Define Your Configuration**

Let's create a Python dictionary to hold our settings. A dictionary stores information as `key: value` pairs.

```python
# Define our settings in a dictionary
uc2_settings = {
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100", # The IP of our UC2 device
    "timeout": 10                 # Wait max 10 seconds for responses
    # Add other settings here later if needed
}

print("Configuration defined:")
print(uc2_settings)
```

Here, we've stored the IP address and a new setting, `timeout`, in a dictionary called `uc2_settings`. If the IP changes, we only need to change it in this one spot!

**Step 2: Create `UC2Client` Using the Configuration**

Now, instead of giving `UC2Client` just the IP address string, let's assume it can accept our settings dictionary. (The exact way `UC2Client` accepts configuration might vary slightly, but the principle is the same).

```python
# Import the client class (if not already done)
from uc2rest import UC2Client

# Assume UC2Client can take the settings dictionary directly 
# or has a specific parameter for it. 
# Let's try passing it as a keyword argument.
# (Check the UC2-REST documentation for the exact method)
client = UC2Client(config=uc2_settings) 

print(f"Client created using configuration for device at {uc2_settings['ip_address']}") 
```

Now, the `client` object knows both the IP address *and* the timeout value, loaded from our `uc2_settings` dictionary.

*Note:* How configuration is passed (`config=uc2_settings` vs. `UC2Client(**uc2_settings)` or other methods) depends on how `UC2Client` is designed. The key idea is separating settings from the main logic. Often, libraries also support reading settings from files (like `config.yaml` or `settings.json`) or environment variables, which is even more flexible, especially for sensitive data like API keys. For now, using a dictionary keeps things simple.

**Step 3: Use the Client as Before**

You can now use the `client` object just like in Chapter 1. The difference is that it's using the settings we provided.

```python
# Use the client to get the device status
try:
    status_info = client.get_status() 
    print("Successfully retrieved status using configured settings:")
    print(status_info) 
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Could not get status: {e}")
```

The script logic (`client.get_status()`) remains the same! But now, if the UC2 device's IP changes, you only need to update the `uc2_settings` dictionary at the top of your script (or in a separate configuration file), and the rest of your code works without modification.

## Under the Hood: How Configuration is Used

When you create the `UC2Client` with configuration, what happens inside?

**Conceptual Steps:**

1.  **Initialization:** When you call `UC2Client(config=uc2_settings)`, the `UC2Client` object is created. It likely stores this configuration dictionary internally.
2.  **Method Call:** You call a method like `client.get_status()`.
3.  **Accessing Settings:** Inside the `get_status` method (or other methods), when the client needs a setting (like the IP address to build the URL, or the timeout value for the web request), it looks up that value in its stored configuration. For example, it retrieves `"192.168.1.100"` for the IP and `10` for the timeout.
4.  **Using Settings:** It uses these retrieved values to perform its task (e.g., constructing the URL `http://192.168.1.100/status` and setting the request timeout to 10 seconds).
5.  **Operation:** The rest of the process (sending the request, receiving the response) happens as described in Chapter 1, but guided by the configuration values.

**Sequence Diagram:**

This diagram shows how the configuration is used internally:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant YourScript as Your Script
    participant ConfigDict as Configuration Dictionary
    participant UC2ClientObj as UC2Client Object
    participant UC2DeviceAPI as UC2 REST API

    YourScript->>ConfigDict: Define uc2_settings = {...}
    YourScript->>UC2ClientObj: client = UC2Client(config=uc2_settings)
    activate UC2ClientObj
    UC2ClientObj->>UC2ClientObj: Store configuration internally
    deactivate UC2ClientObj
    YourScript->>UC2ClientObj: client.get_status()
    activate UC2ClientObj
    UC2ClientObj->>UC2ClientObj: Retrieve 'ip_address' from stored config
    UC2ClientObj->>UC2ClientObj: Retrieve 'timeout' from stored config
    UC2ClientObj->>UC2ClientObj: Prepare HTTP GET request using retrieved settings
    UC2ClientObj->>UC2DeviceAPI: Send GET http://<config_ip>/status (with config_timeout)
    activate UC2DeviceAPI
    UC2DeviceAPI-->>UC2ClientObj: Send HTTP Response
    deactivate UC2DeviceAPI
    UC2ClientObj->>UC2ClientObj: Process response
    UC2ClientObj-->>YourScript: Return status_info
    deactivate UC2ClientObj

```

**Simplified Code Glimpse:**

Let's peek inside a *conceptual* version of `UC2Client` to see how it might store and use the configuration.

```python
# NOTE: This is a simplified conceptual example.
# It might live inside the uc2rest/UC2Client.py file

import requests 

class UC2Client:
    def __init__(self, config):
        """Initializes the client using a configuration dictionary."""
        # Store the provided configuration dictionary
        self.config = config 
        # Maybe perform some validation or setup based on config
        self.base_url = f"http://{self.config.get('ip_address', 'localhost')}" 
        self.timeout = self.config.get('timeout', 5) # Default timeout 5s if not provided
        print(f"Client initialized with base URL: {self.base_url} and timeout: {self.timeout}s")

    def get_status(self):
        """Gets the status, using configured IP and timeout."""
        status_url = f"{self.base_url}/status" 
        try:
            # Use the timeout value from the stored configuration
            response = requests.get(status_url, timeout=self.timeout) 
            response.raise_for_status() 
            status_data = response.json() 
            return status_data
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Error fetching status: {e}")
            # Potentially use logging here - see next chapter!
            raise 
        
    # ... other methods would also use self.config or derived values ...
```

In this example:
*   The `__init__` method takes the `config` dictionary and stores it in `self.config`. It also immediately uses `config.get(...)` to extract the `ip_address` and `timeout`, providing default values if they are missing.
*   The `get_status` method uses `self.base_url` (derived from the config's IP) and `self.timeout` (from the config) when making the web request using the `requests` library.

This shows how the configuration provided during setup guides the behavior of the client's methods later on.

## Conclusion

Well done! You've learned why hardcoding settings like IP addresses isn't flexible and how **Configuration Management** solves this. Think of it as a "settings menu" for your `UC2Client`. By defining settings (like IP address and timeouts) in a separate place (like a dictionary), you can easily change how your script connects and operates without touching the core logic. This makes your scripts more maintainable and adaptable.

You saw how to define a configuration dictionary and potentially pass it to `UC2Client` during initialization. The client then uses these settings internally when performing actions like `get_status()`.

As your scripts get more complex, knowing what's happening inside becomes important. What if an error occurs? How do you track the steps your script takes? That's where logging comes in.
