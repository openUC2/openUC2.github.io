# Tutorial: Mach-Zehnder Interferometer

In this workshop, we will construct a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer using the openUC2 modular microscope toolbox. The Mach-Zehnder Interferometer is a powerful optical device that enables quantitative phase imaging and split-beam interferometry, making it invaluable for microscopy applications, materials science, and precision measurements.

The QBox is a collaboration between openUC2 and OQ3

### Theory of Operation

The Mach-Zehnder Interferometer splits coherent light into two separate paths (reference and sample arms) using the first beam splitter. The reference beam travels through air or a known medium, while the sample beam passes through or reflects from the specimen being studied. Both beams are then recombined at a second beam splitter, creating an interference pattern that contains information about the optical path differences introduced by the sample.

Unlike the Michelson Interferometer, the Mach-Zehnder design provides separate, independent paths for reference and sample beams, offering greater flexibility for sample insertion and manipulation. This configuration is particularly advantageous for transmission microscopy and quantitative phase imaging applications.

### Theoretical Background

**Split-Beam Interferometry Principles**

The Mach-Zehnder Interferometer operates on the principle of amplitude division, where the incident beam is split into two components of approximately equal intensity. Each beam travels through different optical paths before being recombined. The resulting interference pattern depends on:

1. **Optical Path Difference (OPD)**: $$\Delta = n_1 L_1 - n_2 L_2$$, where n is the refractive index and L is the path length
2. **Phase Difference**: $$\delta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \times \text{OPD}$$
3. **Interference Condition**: Constructive interference occurs when $$\delta = 2\pi m$$ (m = integer)

**Mathematical Description of Interference**

The intensity distribution in the interference pattern is given by:
$$
I(x,y) = I_1 + I_2 + 2\sqrt{I_1 I_2}\cos[\varphi(x,y)]
$$

Where $$\varphi(x,y)$$ represents the local phase difference caused by sample-induced optical path variations.

**Quantitative Phase Imaging**

One of the most powerful applications of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer is quantitative phase imaging, which allows measurement of:
- **Refractive index variations** in transparent samples
- **Thickness variations** in thin films and biological specimens  
- **Dynamic processes** in living cells and materials
- **Density fluctuations** in fluids and gases

The phase shift introduced by a transparent object is:
$$
\Delta\varphi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \times t \times (n_{\text{sample}} - n_{\text{medium}})
$$

Where t is the thickness and n represents refractive indices.

**Phase Unwrapping and Data Analysis**

The interference fringes contain phase information that must be extracted through mathematical processing:
- **Fringe analysis**: Determines local phase from fringe spacing and orientation
- **Phase unwrapping**: Removes 2π ambiguities to obtain continuous phase maps
- **Quantitative measurements**: Converts phase data to physical quantities (thickness, refractive index, etc.)

**Sensitivity and Resolution Considerations**

The system sensitivity depends on:
- **Phase sensitivity**: $$\Delta\varphi_{\text{min}} \approx \frac{\lambda}{100 \times \text{visibility}}$$, typically $$\sim \frac{\lambda}{100}$$ for good systems
- **Spatial resolution**: Limited by numerical aperture of imaging system
- **Temporal resolution**: Determined by camera frame rate and sample dynamics

**Comparison with Other Interferometric Techniques**

| Technique | Advantages | Disadvantages | Best Applications |
|-----------|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Mach-Zehnder | Separate beam paths, easy sample access | Requires stable environment | Transmission microscopy, flow studies |
| Michelson | Compact, simple alignment | Reflection-based, limited sample access | Surface profiling, displacement measurement |
| Shearing | Self-referencing, robust | Complex data analysis | Turbulence studies, wave front sensing |

**Modern Applications and Technology Transfer**

Mach-Zehnder Interferometry has found extensive applications in:
- **Biomedical imaging**: Cell biology, tissue analysis, drug testing
- **Materials science**: Thin film characterization, surface analysis  
- **Quality control**: Industrial inspection, defect detection
- **Fluid dynamics**: Flow visualization, density measurements
- **Telecommunications**: Fiber optic testing, optical component characterization
- **Astronomical interferometry**: High-resolution imaging of celestial objects

NEVER SWITCH ON THE LASER WITHOUT INTENDED USE

5. **Position a pinhole screen** in front of
one of the exits. If necessary, place the screen next to the grid to increase the distance.

5. **Adjust the mirrors** so that the two partial beams lie exactly on top of each other on the screen behind
the pinhole. Remove the pinhole when an interference pattern is visible.

## Basic Interferometry Setup and Alignment

### 1.1: Establish Interference Fringes

Turn on the laser and observe the interference pattern. Adjust the reference mirror to create clear, visible fringes across the field of view.

*TODO: Add image of properly aligned fringe pattern*

### 1.2: Characterize Fringe Properties

Measure and document:
- Fringe spacing and orientation
- Fringe contrast (visibility)
- Stability over time

### 1.3: Sensitivity Testing

Make small adjustments to the reference mirror and observe how the fringe pattern responds. This demonstrates the high sensitivity of interferometric measurements.
