# Day 0: Planning

:::tip

If this is your first time deploying a FRAME machine, we strongly recommend going through the [full tutorials](../../tutorials/day-1/README.md) instead, so that you can learn how to use the FRAME effectively. The guides here are not written to facilitate learning.

:::

The how-to guides here are written for people who already have previous familiarity with deploying FRAME machines.
Here, we assume that you just need guidance for planning a successful deployment of another FRAME machine, or for re-deploying an existing FRAME machine.

1. [Hardware Assembly](./hw-assembly/README.md): these guides help you to plan the final assembly of your FRAME machine's hardware.
2. [Software Installation](./sw-install/README.md): these guides help you to determine whether you will need to install any software and/or firmware onto your FRAME machine, and what software and/or firmware you will need to install.
3. [Machine Connectivity](./connectivity/README.md): these guides help you to determine how you will connect to your FRAME machine's software, and how you will make your machine's software easy to access— since the FRAME supports many ways of doing these things depending on your operational requirements.
