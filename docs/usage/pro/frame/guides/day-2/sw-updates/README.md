# Software Updates

## How to upgrade

### to the latest development version

1. Enter the RPi's terminal.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   forklift pallet upgrade @main
   ```
3. Reboot the RPi, e.g. by running:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

If the above command fails with an error message that you have changes which are not yet saved in a Git commit or which might not be in a remote Git repo:

1. Run the following command to check for uncommitted changes:
   ```bash
   git -C ~/.local/share/forklift/pallet/ status
   ```

2. Run the following command to check for unpushed commits:
   ```bash
   git -C ~/.local/share/forklift/pallet/ log
   ```

3. Decide whether you want to `git commit` and `git push` any changes listed in the output of that command before performing the software upgrade.

4. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   forklift pallet upgrade --force @main
   ```

   :::warning

   This command will permanently delete any local changes you've made!
   You'll lose any changes which you haven't already backed up (e.g. by committing and pushing them to GitHub).

5. Reboot the RPi, e.g. by running:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```
