Have fun experimenting with different setups and learning more about the wave-particle duality of light!"))}p.isMDXComponent=!0},44682:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/IMG_20230812_144127-2da8b1dc7fa9c3ee0508aae02fccfb08.jpg"},39940:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/IMG_20230812_144849-50810f025a112a507b132a5e54b28994.jpg"},28412:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/IMG_20230812_144857-5c94d4985261c9e79730d82298c46435.jpg"},69136:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/Michelson_1-efbc965148647a8087127c097feb9e80.png"},99307:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/Michelson_2-a0ee9d49091bc1f5dadafebe8d94573f.png"},35723:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/Michelson_3-fe6724c32fa9798d3dbf452f0ea73678.png"},58592:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/Michelson_4-63275f63c4b2eecc9fb215445528ff1c.png"},52676:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/Michelson_5-fec170b5698a852227f0c446a6a83ab1.png"},31980:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/Michelson_6-6ba3104f89fd51922eee68e119befdf3.png"},32568:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image102-5edbc8e17b464a6c50f4b17116efb88b.jpg"},55943:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image106-10bab2087bd1c2f41d9226985145d475.jpg"},9459:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image108-fb0fc36d5b8389400e610adfb6c60987.jpg"},45367:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image113-60712c04bfc36138db4fa8ae248b9d35.png"},53328:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image115-1d5312faf930a39219a048caafccdc54.jpg"},1774:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image118-32981615ea78e0bdae57ffbb40832424.jpg"},43150:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image122-3fb004e7909261d58d2b6f6cc939b659.jpg"},2016:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image123-3cf546fe63094b0c2cf65b11810cdae4.jpg"},90937:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image14-90432cbe34cbf765499d6c5777e46b11.jpg"},93332:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image16-f2cd81ce155b62e5502fbda29684ba5c.jpg"},26856:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image23-db759bc70dab67fdb01050b450c44ae2.jpg"},55032:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image29-e36eef1f02346ce02c04b3140eeb2369.jpg"},5899:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image35-a6861e9174a744acd7b2c22bd0587e79.jpg"},43969:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image36-dbc20ce30e316e1bf010c69e14fc540d.png"},4295:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image37-437c3864712689c5f306481b9428b21d.png"},46266:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image41-271e11e87f9dbdce257e3514a4796e35.png"},14158:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image42-12a00233a4965cf0811d58ffe6b69fc0.jpg"},40170:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image43-1e6d6622b2a6072334be0faf90632b36.jpg"},76209:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image47-8d1c863872e6bb4d8681cfbf3edffb39.jpg"},50308:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image51-f56e384f7e8417a39e1cf6a3bce6d2d5.jpg"},20461:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image55-79b3f7b0e3dbfc21b001afac7bce5706.jpg"},15302:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image60-c0aa4f9105dadab25ba52c4e92efab03.jpg"},87414:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image65-aa768026722ee19268dbf63dccfdbeb2.png"},24305:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image66-3258b858c499b0fff5ce964009852f1d.jpg"},74018:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image67-cd481e7676aafdbe0b1e4aa822fae898.jpg"},34377:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image73-d6b91a4252de08e0debd3a87ee8aa1d5.jpg"},31341:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image80-fa9b862bba3ccc5c327f6497f3c37400.png"},93171:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image82-245a711b9f46c5f9f3b242a613cf4169.png"},73637:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image88-ae3443b867638c5fc222898abaff743d.jpg"},11635:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image91-f27e7de4c1b761a5a626363dab90f677.jpg"},50117:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image94-eba561604c664a22c382763a218805ae.jpg"},3665:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=r.p+"assets/images/image97-0875aaea1f817c36cde75042a4423f65.jpg"}}]);
