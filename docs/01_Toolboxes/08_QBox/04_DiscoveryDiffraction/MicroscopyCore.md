The first version of this BOX was designed for the ["Principles of Light Microscopy" Course](https://www.biodip.de/resources/courses/light-microscopy/) of the Light Microscopy Facility of MPI-CBG in Dresden. The alignment procedure was developed and optimised by Sebastian Bundschuh. It follows the lectures of Peter Evennett that can be found [here](https://www.biodip.de/resources/teaching-material/basic-optical-concepts/).

CourseBOX teaches the core principles of microscopy and basics of optical alignment. It is intended for microscopy courses for students that are rather on the side of users than designers. This BOX provides a hands-on experience with insight into the black box that microscope often seems to be. It comes with alignment tutorials and relies on basic components. By reusing the components and starting from the common ground, it shows that all the microscopy methods are based on only a few principles.

It is not yet a comprehensive and optimised toolbox but rather a collection of modules and experiments that are frequently taught in microscopy courses. There is still space for improvement and we're hoping that more universities and institutions adopt the CourseBOX in their courses, which will lead to it's improvement and (if successful) production.

What can you build with the CourseBOX?

### Compound microscope with proper Köhler illumination (finite optics)
A finite corrected microscope with proper Köhler illumination. All conjugate planes are accessible.

</p>

### Abbe Diffraction Experiment (finite optics)
Classical experiment for explaining Fourier transform done by a lens. The illumination stays the same as in the previous experiment, but a beamsplitter and a relay lens are added, for simultaneous observation the Primary Image Plane and the Back Focal Plane.

### Abbe Diffraction Experiment (infinity optics)
Classical experiment for explaining Fourier transform done by a lens. The setup of the previous experiment is reused and a laser pointer is added as a light source.

#### Coming soon:
### Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope
Laser Scanning system is built on the detection side of the same setup. Scanning mirror can be rotated around one axis, which results in the translation of the point on the sample.

### Light Sheet Microscope
The principle of Selective Plane illumination Microscopy is demonstrated with white light. The illumination path stays the same, only the collector lens is exchanged for a cylindrical one. The detection path is rotated by 90°.
