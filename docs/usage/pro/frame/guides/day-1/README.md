# Day 1: Deployment

:::tip

If this is your first time deploying a FRAME machine, we strongly recommend going through the [full tutorials](../../tutorials/day-1/README.md) instead, so that you can learn how to use the FRAME effectively. The guides here are not written to facilitate learning.

:::

The how-to guides here are written for people who already have previous familiarity with deploying FRAME machines.
Here, we assume that you have already [planned](../day-0/README.md) your next FRAME machine deployment or re-deployment, and you just need to know how to achieve certain outcomes in deployment.

1. [Hardware Assembly](./hw-assembly/README.md): these guides help you perform final assembly of your FRAME machine's hardware, so that the FRAME hardware will be ready for use.
2. [Software Installation](./sw-install/README.md): these guides help you to perform any necessary installation of software and firmware onto your FRAME machine's hardware, so that the FRAME machine can be turned on.
3. [Machine Connectivity](./connectivity/README.md): these guides help you to connect to your FRAME machine's software, and to make your machine's software easy to access.
